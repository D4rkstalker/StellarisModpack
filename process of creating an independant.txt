# randomly
 # no chain, they pop up with a popup
 # Random ethics, was always going to happen
 # Can happen unlimited number of times depending on space
 # Can happen to both human and AI

# Refugees
 # Generated and colonies from a refugee.
 # Examples, fleeing crisis, fleeing rogue servitors, fleeing assimilators, fleeing purging, self-mods being arrogant, being displaced.

# Event Chain
 # Embezzeled funds
 # Private ships from a corp?
 # Slave revolt?
 # admiral rebellion?
 # Sponsored expedition
 # potential for vassal
 # potential for protectorate
 # Consolidated scavenegers
 # One or Two per playthrough
 # Can happen to both players and AI

# Independants characteristics
 # Will found on a planet if available wihtin range of teh triggering nation
 # If not (and with later investigation) Will spawn a ramshackle station/habitat that they will occupy
 # Planet will be immediately colonised with 5 pops, station will be spawned then colonised with 3 pops.
 # station will have 10 housing base and max, maybe a district that maks scavver jobs and one that makes food. station can come later though
 # potential for the founded independant to have a bonus - extra researched techs, unique modifiers on planets or some fallen empire ships depending on what happens.
 # colonies should have a chance to spawn every 5-10 years
 # colonies have a 10 year grace period of refusing all diplomatic communication as they cool down from their separation.
 # colonies -typically- have a negative opinion malus from the empire that spawned them, they are independants of that sibling rivalry and all. This will be excaerbated by ethics. A spawned purifier from a multi-species egalitarian race will be at extreme odds to competing democratic crusaders. Base modifier is -50, traitors is -100. Sponsored is +20. This goes both ways. The opinion degrades by 2 per year.
 # Minors will spawn with a native increase to nav cap of 50, resource production of +10 to each resource excluding rare resources
 # Minors otherwise have all the features of a regular empire
