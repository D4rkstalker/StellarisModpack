#######RING ENTITIES#######
###These are in turn attached to the ring rigs, which are animated and are then attached to the main entity.

#######RING RIGS##########

#########ANIMATIONS##########
###Should be self explanatory.
###UNIVERSAL FOR ALL VANILLA GFXCULTURES. IF YOU NEED TO USE YOUR OWN, REFERENCE IT HERE.
