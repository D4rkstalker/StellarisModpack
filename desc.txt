[h1]Features[/h1]
Pantheons of the Void is a mod I have been working on the last month. I have heard some of you guys would like a religion expansion in Stellaris and since we all know Paradox is working on a Federations expansion, I thought it would be nice if we could get both!

In Pantheons of the Void you will be able to chose your religious system in the empire creation screen, this selection will determine what your empire supports as faith. Faith or Religious systems go from Atheism to Animatism.

Having pops that believe in other religious systems will cause some pops to start abandoning their work posts to start preaching about their faith


Heresy Preachers consume their base costs and provide attraction towards said faith system. The empires attraction can be found in the new faction window


One preacher job is added every 10 heretics to a maximum of 10 preachers. So having them in your planets will cause a cascade effect in them. Here comes the council of faiths!

The Council of Faiths Window gives players the necesary tools to deal with heresy. Players will be allowed to chose between two paths, the Flexible and the Dogmatic by using their influence. They can even bribe the council to get their support with the mob and get some extra influence in dire times.


The Flexible path is a set of religious traditions that work towards understanding and being flexible about other forms of faith. By doing so, you can tax heresy preachers, create ominist forums or even get some sweet new casus belli against dogmatic empires

Now, if being flexible and all loving is not your thing or The Emperor of Mankind guides you, the dogmatic way is what you are looking for!

The Dogmatic path allows you to deal with heresy as the emperor commands, ban them, purify them with fire or brainwash the blasphemous beings into the light.

With this path you will also be able to send missionaries to rival empires (that do not have your same faith system).

Missionaries will add a lot of attraction towards your faith system in a random planet of the selected rival.

If you send a missionary and the empire has over 55% of pops that follow your religious system, they will be forced to change their system and their ruler will have to abdicate.

OR! you can be MORE aggressive and send your fleets instead! At the end of every path there is a Total war casus belli. Dogmatics will be allowed to purge the infidels while Flexibles will be able to crush the souls of the dogmiatics.

The mod is in alpha stage and only regular empires are supported (i intend to provide support for gestalt and megacorps too with new custom religious traditions). Bugs are expected, game balance might not be final and some localizations are missing BUT im providing with early access to anybody who wants to test this awesome mod and provide feedback!


[h1]Current Stage: [b]ALPHA[/b][/h1]



Alpha stage: expect bugs, missing localisations, icons, imbalance.
Beta stage: expect bugs, imbalance
Release: expect minor bugs
Following updates: Expect NEW stuff to be added periodicaly

Thanks to the support patreons provide, I will continue to develop on this mod. Hopefully I will get enough support to add all the features I would like, which include:

Specific Civics
Support for gestalt
Support for megacorp
Factions (maybe)
Lots of events related to religion and heresy
Mid game crisis (The Prophet)
Government types (maybe)
War names (based on new casus bellis)
and more!
