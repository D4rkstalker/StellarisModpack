This is the first major expansion to Wild Space. The core concept, included in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2112680970] Main Mod[/url] is to make galactic geography matter add uncolonisable "wild space" systems. That prevents the entire map from being locked down by empire borders, helps to make the galaxy feel bigger and to allow more movement and exploration. It also adds differential hyperlane density between "wild" and "normal" space, links areas of wild space to the core via wormhole, and adds optional new galaxy maps that dramatically increases the proportion of systems that are within a nebula. 

A full description of the mechanic can be found on the workshop page for the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2112680970] Main Mod[/url].

This expansion pack: 
[list]
[*]allows for the fortification of Wild Space, using specialised Deep Space Sensor Stations and Fortresses and encourages conflict in those regions; 
[*]enables gateway networks to extend in Wild Space; 
[*]enables players to access late game methods to stabalise and control Wild Space, combatting border gore and enabling the construction of forward starbases from which to launch distant campaigns; and
[*]encourages the AI to more aggressively expand across Wild Space. 
[/list]

It also integrates a number of graphical tweaks, including the Galaxy texture from the amazing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1506085043] Pinwheel Galaxy (Purple)[/url] around which this mods nebulae graphics were designed. You can override this texture if you wish by placing any other galaxy texture mod below this one. Be warned, though that all or most other nebulae textures are uncomfortably bright when used for the dramatically larger nebulae in this mod's custom maps.
