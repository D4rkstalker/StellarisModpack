[h1]Patch 1.5.0[/h1]
- Updated the mod to work with Stellaris 3.7.4

- Removed the direct ethics attraction system for high-level resolutions due to it being too powerful. The old system remains, where resolutions give progressive ethic attraction bonuses and penalties;

- Added diplomatic weight bonuses and penalties to the high-level Divinity of Life and Galactic Studies resolutions;

- Reworked the vanilla Mutual Defense, Rules of War, Divinity of Life and Galactic Studies resolution AI weights to make it more realistic (added a bunch of new modifiers and changed existing ones - for example, I added an ongoing crisis weight penalty to the level 5 and 6 Rules of War resolutions to prevent AI from wanting to reduce their naval cap during a crisis);

- Adjusted Defense Privatization AI weights;

- Changed how AI picks Social Welfare and Utopian Abundance living standards to fix some bugs that caused AI to not correctly change away from a banned living standard;

- Tweaked a few AI weight modifiers for the Xenophile resolutions;

- Changed some of the effects from the level 6 Rules of War resolution and the level 6 Galactic Studies resolution.
