[h1]Patch 1.9.1[/h1]
- Added a new system of ethic attraction for resolutions which makes it so that ethic attraction bonuses are only given to empires that don't have it as a governing ethic. This system was implemented to prevent excessive ethic attraction to one single ethic, completely overshdowing other ethics;

- Made AI care much less about denouncement/castigation resolutions during an ongoing crisis, especially the Custodian/Emperor, to focus on the threat at hand better (Note: I might implement this to other resolutions in the future);

- Fixed a few bugs carried over from the old NGS mod;

- Made egalitarian AI want to unseat the custodian more if there's no crisis, they don't have good relations with them and if the Custodianship term is perpetual;

- Adjusted egalitarian and authoritarian AI weights for the Stratification and Greater Good resolutions to make them less opposed to the lower level resolutions as they give a lot of benefits without many penalties;

- Added Space Amoeba and Crystalline Entity resolution breach fixes to the decade GC pulse enabling AI empires to fix their situation;

- Small changes to AI weights for the Xenophile resolutions;

- Lowered base weight for the lvl 1 and 2 Mischief and Megacorp resolutions;

- Lowered the weight for federation allies on sanction repeals for when a member is in breach;

- Minor adjustments to the low level Xenophobe resolution AI weights;

- Fixed a bug that could potentially cause gestalt empires to shift to normal ethics (e.g. Authoritarian/Egalitarian hiveminds);

- Plenty of bug fixes on events and modifiers.
