[h1]Patch 1.6.0[/h1]
- Updated the mod to work with Stellaris 3.8.1

- Added triggered modifiers to the higher level resolutions to fix a bug that caused the diplo weight penalties/bonuses to not persist;

- Modified how AI picks certain living standards and citizenship types to fix some bugs with resolution breaches;

- Switched the Charter of Sentient Rights resolution with Stellar Diplomatic Forums as the slavery ban was too early in the category;

- Reworked gestalt resolution AI weights to allow for more flexibility in voting;

- Changed the modifiers for the Stratification resolutions;

- Nerfed the lvl 5 and 6 Healthcare resolutions (happiness);

- Capitalized the names of the banned policies for the Xenophile and Xenophobe resolutions;

- Reduced the AI weight for the Galactic History resolutions due to them not having noticeable positive effects (the first one actually doesn't have any positive effects at all, and the second introduces a huge minerals penalty that can easily crash one's economy) - they need a rework;

- Fixed some bugs with banned policies and diplo weight penalties.
