[h1]Patch 1.8.0[/h1]
- Made it so that if the Pax Galactica emperor resolution is active and there are no more threats (i.e. all FEs/AEs are gone, crisis is over), AI, even militarists, will have much higher attraction to Rules of War resolutions and much less to Mutual Defense resolutions;

- Adjusted weights for council position resolutions;

- Updated the Xenophobe resolution modifiers to be more useful;

- Changed modifiers for Authoritarian resolutions to make them more severe for the higher level resolutions;

- Changed AI weights for council denouncement and castigation to make them less frequent;

- Vastly improved AI weights for Emperor resolutions;

- The lvl 6 Rules of War resolution now bans Liberation Wars also, leaving Defensive Wars the only option - Full Galactic Peace;

- Limited category diplo weight penalties to -100% to fix a bug that caused negative values to display;

- Made the AI weight penalty from recently passed sanctions bigger to (hopefully) make AI no longer spam these resolutions;

- Made AI propose less repeal sanctions resolutions to prevent spamming;

- Made non-council GC AI members care less about the council seat number;

- Improved modifiers for the Xenophobe resolutions.
