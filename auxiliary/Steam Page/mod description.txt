Featured in Odin Gamings top 10 Stellaris Mods of 2017!

[h1]Intro[/h1]
This mod adds 45 new Ascension Perks to the game. Designate your planets as Forge Worlds our garden worlds, find new mineral deposits and unlock special rare technologies to be discovered.

I have tried to keep away from "Boring" stuff (like +25% Border Range). There is still a few perks like that, but I have tried to make things as fun as possible. A lot of the perks have more to them than what is written in the description (It would have become far to long!). I will upload a list with detailed descriptions among the discussions were you can check closer what each perk do (in addition to a list with a shorter description of each perk).

Example Perks
[list]
[*] Deep Core Mining: Lets you discover new mineral deposits on a planet, but reduces its happiness and habitability.
[*] Planetary Consumption [Hive Minds Only]: Lets you consume a planet, turning it barren but yields large quantities of resources.
[*] Ultimate Ascension & Perfect Ascension: Unlocks the ability to combine the perks from the various ascension paths (including one new tier 2 perk added to each path).[/list]

[list]
[*] Unity when destroying enemy ships/stations.
[*] Adds new trait to all leaders.
[*] Bonus while no active trade deals.
[*] Select virtues for new rulers.
and a lot more![/list]

[h1]Balance[/h1]
Ascension Perks are by nature supposed to be a bit OP, which makes balancing them harder. I've gotten some good input since the release of the mod, but if you have any thoughts on balance, please contact me!

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This is compatible with everything that does not modify the vanilla ascension perk file. The reason for me modifying this file is to allow people to combine the various ascension paths (through the Ultimate and Perfect Ascension Ascension Perks). If there is much demand for a compatibility patch with certain mods I can make that.

[h1]Localisation[/h1]
The mod features English localisation for several non-English languages (so you will see English text). [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670045745]Russian Localisation[/url] has kindly been provided by @resident-tt. If you are interested in helping with proper localisation, please contact me!
