Featured in Odin Gamings top 10 Stellaris Mods of 2017!

Mod has been recently updated, but if you want to finish old saves on the current version, please check out the legacy version: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1941510469

[h1]Intro[/h1]
This mod over 50 new Ascension Perks to the game. Designate your planets as Forge Worlds our Ecumenopolises, gain Interest on your stored energy credits or unlock special rare technologies to be discovered.

I have tried to keep away from "Boring" stuff (like +25% Border Range). There are still a few perks like that, but I have tried to make things as fun as possible. A lot of the perks have more to them than what is written in the description (It would have become far to long!). I will upload a list with detailed descriptions among the discussions were you can check closer what each perk do (in addition to a list with a shorter description of each perk).

Example Perks
[list]
[*] Deep Core Mining: Lets you discover new mineral deposits on a planet, but reduces its happiness and habitability.
[*] Planetary Consumption [Hive Minds Only]: Lets you consume a planet, turning it barren but yields large quantities of resources.
[*] Ultimate Ascension & Perfect Ascension: Unlocks the ability to combine the perks from the various ascension paths (including one new tier 2 perk added to each path).[/list]

[h1]Expanded Stellaris Traditions[/h1]
Check out my other mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946222466]Expanded Stellaris Traditions[/url] which adds 48 new Tradition Trees to the game!

[b]Example traditions:[/b]
[list]
[*] Unity when destroying enemy ships/stations.
[*] Bonus to planets with at least 3 different species.
[*] Adds new trait to all leaders.
[*] Bonus while no active trade deals.
[*] Convert other empires pops to your ethics.
and a lot more![/list]

[h1]Balance[/h1]
Ascension Perks are by nature supposed to be a bit OP, which makes balancing them harder. I've gotten some good input since the release of the mod, but if you have any thoughts on balance, please contact me!

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This is compatible with everything that do not modify the vanilla ascension perk file. The reason for me modifying this file is to allow people to combine the various ascension paths (through the Ultimate and Perfect Ascension Ascension Perks). If there is much demand for a compatibility patch with certain mods I can make that.

[h1]Localisation[/h1]
The mod features English localisation for several non English languages (so you will see English text). If you are interested in helping with proper localisation, please contact me!
