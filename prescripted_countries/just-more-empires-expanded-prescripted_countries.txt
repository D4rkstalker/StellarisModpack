The native molluscoids of Naff'Lin, the Tymosh, live in neurosymbiosis with an eel-like creature. Their all-encompassing church promotes the belief that all sentient beings (and the economies that they generate) exist in a similar relationship with an otherworldly spirit known as the Invisible Tentacle. Contacting that spirit, which is most often attempted to win its favor in some material pursuit or another, is achieved through a series of complex rituals and investment decisions. The more financially advantageous those investments are to the Adherence, the greater the spiritual rapture... or so they say."

This gave several species of mammalians an evolutionary opportunity, and in time one of them came to dominate the planet and develop an industrial civilization. Their industry soon began to melt the ice, releasing ancient spores long ago trapped in the permafrost. Most were harmless, but one species of awoken fungi had a unique psychoactive effect on the population. The Amaranth first hijacked its victims' central nervous systems and drove them into a ravening zombie-like madness. Past a certain point of saturation, however, it began to unlock the nascent telepathic potential of its hosts, creating a networked consciousness of its own. Melding its own fundamental impulses with the baser instincts of its victims, the Efflorescence hungers greedily and insatiably for expansion. The total consumption of Grithor was completed swiftly, and the Amaranth may yet consume the entire galaxy."

Post-war reforms established a federalized global government with both representative and privy councils under the leadership of the Emperor. To administer global affairs, ensure societal control, and drive economic prosperity, the crown established the Imperial Enterprise. The Enterprise is a massive nationalized corporation to which a sizeable percentage of the Raskenese population is indentured, many by their own choice. Terms of voluntary indenture last between five and fifty years, offer proportionate benefits upon completion, and typically involve less grueling and dangerous labor than 'punitive' or 'reformative' indenture.

Technology swiftly progressed, leading to increased contact and trade between Terra's great powers. Brutal conflicts with the Chinese and Indian empires over spheres of influence cost many lives, but did little to forestall the Roman Emperors' dominance of their  homeworld. By the industrial age, however, the power of the mercantile elector class within Rome's upper echelons grew to outstrip that of the Senate and even the Emperor himself. These old imperial institutions still exist in the Interstellar Age, but as mere figureheads. Deeply embedded within Terran science, industry, and finance, the Church holds the true reins of power. While the Emperor remains head of state, the highest ecclesiastic leader in Terran society, the Supreme Pontif, is its de facto ruler. This civilization of fortune-building priests, built on the backs of a billion slaves and controlled by an impenetrable bureaucracy, now aims to own the stars themselves."

Once trapped, their victims can expect a slow torture by endless rambling hyperbolic conversation and frantic attempts by the Phasgol to demonstrate their cultural savvy and social value.

They named it Miranda. There, the colonists quickly put into practice a brave new genetic engineering program to rapidly adapt to the alien planet. In the process, their society bifurcated. A small population of genetically superior and cybernetically enhanced humans grown (or 'decanted') in labs, calling themselves Mirandans, assumed leadership of the colony. Meanwhile, a rapidly reproducing population of genetically labotomized subhuman laborers, called Calibans, were tasked with the hard and dangerous frontier duties of colonial expansion. This experiment enabled the extremely rapid settlement of Miranda and a return to spaceflight within a century of their arrival, but its long-term societal costs can only be guessed at. Mirandans typically distinguish themselves from Calibans by wearing white, grey, or silver clothing."

A consequence of their genetic modifications, however, is accelerated telomeric degeneration, resulting in shorter average lifespans."

Its followers and advocates spoke of a collective Human consciousness that was expanding beyond a crucial point. At last Humanity was ready to accept life's fundamental truth: that life's only purpose is life itself. Learning to extend their awareness outward, beyond the self of body, to embrace the self of group and the self of Humanity, followers found sollace amid endless turmoil. This movement came to dominate Earth, where most now see the goals of the group and the wider species as transcendent, and believe embracing them is to achieve enlightenment. Those who cannot or do not conform to these fundamental realities can be re-educated or, failing that, sent into the reprocessing tanks to become one with all the people."

This cabal detected and mind-controlled several teams of alien observers, who were as yet unaware of the psionic potential of their Zegalan subjects. Over more than forty years, their thralls were carefully manipulated and infiltrated into key positions, while advanced alien technology was clandestinely secreted to the Zegalans by way of psionic coercion.

The UN Charter amendment of 2061 created the UN Parliamentary Assembly and Protectorate Council, followed in subsequent years by numerous other structural changes. The old Westphalian system was at last fatally undermined by the rise of this world government backed by the military might of emerging superpowers, Brazil and India. Continued integration eventually led to the asymmetric federalization of all UN member states by 2150. In this scheme, off-world colonies are administered by various types of devolved governments under the oversight of the Protectorate until they can qualify for federal incorporation. Reliable FTL travel via hyperlanes and the prospect of interstellar colonization laid the foundation for the UN to evolve yet further into the United Systems Republic, a responsible representative government advancing the interests of Humanity on the galactic stage."
