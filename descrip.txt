This mod adds unique mechanics or play styles for empires via new civics & origins. They often warp your playstyle in various directions and have things you have to overcome to reap their benifits. The traits and civics often give tech options to further develop the uniqueness of your species' or cultureâ€™s inherent abilities. 

Civics: Space Focused, Planters, Baskers, Traditionless, History OF Skybattles, Sad Socrates, Ancient Shipwrights, Zro Infused, Wilders, Fracturing Consciousness
Origins: Undergrounder, Tiyanki Herders
More on the way.
