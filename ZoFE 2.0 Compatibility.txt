Mod Compatibility issues will be discussed here. As I will be spending less energy making patches and more energy on delivering content, this is a place where people with a little skill in modding can create their own compatibility patches. I will do my best to explain any issues that might or could arise from any sort of mod.


[h1]New Ship Classes[/h1]

When a mod introduces a new type of ship class (such as dreadnoughts, flagship etc.) that is not in the base game, they will not have the graphics for the Fallen Empire ships provided by this mod. Similarly, once you ascend, this mod will not have the Fallen Empire art makeover for these new ship classes. This lack of graphical matching will create 'coloured boxes', but otherwise will not crash the game. AI Ascended Empires are also only scripted to build FE ships from this mod, so they will not build any ship classes provided by others. To make such compatibility patches, you must match my FE ship graphics to any new ship classes introduced this way, so that you won't see those ships as coloured boxes once you Ascend. The limiting of ship set options in the Ascension event (instead of allowing you to keep your ship set) really helps with this or otherwise you will have to attach their graphical culture to my Fallen ships too.

You are welcome to reverse-engineer [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=910501703]this mod[/url] to get an idea how this is done.


[h1]New Ship Sets[/h1]

Aesthetic ship sets do not have the same issues as with new ship classes. Once you become an Ascended Empire, all your ships will still get an FE makeover and look like FE ships.


[h1]New Ascension Perks[/h1]

Generally do not cause any problems. Note that the AI factor for selecting this AP is 1000, meaning if some mod decides to add new Perks that has an AI factor of 10000 AI will pick that first.


[h1]New Technologies[/h1]

Generally do not cause any problems, unless they alter or remove vanilla techs. Galactic Ascendancy requires Dark Matter Drawing for example, and if a mod removes that tech you will not be able to become an Ascended Empire. In terms of balance, this is something for the player to decide which technology mods they want to use. I will create a playlist for others to get an idea of what I play with.


[h1]Altering Awakened Empire Defines, Resource Storage[/h1]

Any mods that changes values defining what Awakened Empires can or can't do (such as resource storage, decadence, ship upkeep) will automatically affect Ascended Empires. Any previous issues of storages being '0' could also be another mod increasing AE storage defines (or yours) so high that it exceeds the 32-bit integer (like the negative fleet power bug). This mod keeps most of the values as is, and only altered the amount of decadence you get per tick, and removed the double research cost for Awakened Empires. This should result in a slight 'buff' of Awakened Empires.


[h1]Crises and Events[/h1]

All crises naturally require the 'default' country type to trigger. What I have done is to replace the default only entry to OR = { is_country_type = default    is_country_type = ascended_empire } so that it can be triggered for both. If another mod alters the Crisis file directly, thereby removing my entry, this would mean that Crises would be unable to contact the player, but would still be triggered by other default empires in the game. To make any country_type triggers compatible with this mod, simply add the new country type.

I also had to expand some of the communication options to trigger for Ascended Empires. Just include both triggers in any compatibility.


[h1]Fallen Empire Buildings[/h1]

Mods that add Fallen Empire buildings without altering vanilla files probably added their own version of the building, made a technology for it, and then overridden the vanilla file for upgrade. When these two mods are run together these things will happen:

[list]

[*]One mod will be loaded first (by alphabetical order). The first loaded mod will get to overwrite the vanilla file and attach their own upgrade path to this vanilla building.

[*]This will result in only ONE viable upgrade path for the building, and one of the mods will provide a redundant path.

[*]From the player perspective, Tier V will still upgrade to FE building, but only one of the potential two FE buildings techs actually lets you upgrade ingame. The other tech is made redundant.

[*]So for example, Mod A requires mega-engineering tech to unlock FE buildings. Mod B requires Ascension Theory. Mod A overwrites Mod B due to alpabetical order, and so you will only need mega-engineering tech to get FE buildings. Ascension Theory will not give you the upgrade despite saying so.

[/list]

But otherwise this will not crash the game. It is of course advisable to only load one mod like this as it does break immersion somewhat.


[h1]00_fallen_empire_subjects[/h1]

In order to provide the ability to create Awakened Empire subjects as both obtainable by war for Ascended Empires and as a diplomatic option, the file has to be overwritten completely. Any mod that does the same will probably cause incompatibility (One mod loading first, rendering the other useless) and you will not be able to create these subjects. A compatibility patch can be made so that it loads before both mods and the codes of both mods are combined.


[h1]Awakened Diplomatic Actions[/h1]

Similar to the above, these actions need to be edited in order for a Casus Belli to show up once a primitive empire refuses your demand for subjugation. You will create a compatibility patch similarly to above where it loads before both mods and the codes of both are combined.


[h1]Empire Policies[/h1]

A number of policies normally only available to default empires have been made available to Ascended Empires. These include:

[list]
[*]War Philosophy

[*]Orbital Bombardment

[*]Border Policy

[*]Refugees Policy

[/list]

To create compatibility patch you will have to create a mod which loads before both mods and combine the codes.


[h1]Scripted Triggers[/h1]

Some triggers are overwritten so as to actually avoid having to overwrite more things. These include:

[list]

[*]planet_can_be_liberated_from_owner (You can¡¦t liberate planets from Ascended Empires, its pops are too fanatical in their beliefs)

[*]is_country_type_with_subjects (Allows Ascended Empire to actually have subjects and the game recognises it can have subjects)

[*]has_alien_comms_with_alien_empire (Encountering Ascended Empire counts as encountering aliens)

[*]has_comms_with_alien_civilization (Same as above)

[*]has_total_war_cb (Enables Ascended Empire to have total war cb at all times.)

[/list]

Again like the previous issues, just create a mod that loads before both mods and incorporate codes/changes of both.

That should be most of them. I might add more should more questions about specific kinds of mod arise, or if I wasn't clear enough above.
