 EMPIRE_DESIGN_akeean_desc:0 "The Bobo developed on a shielded world. Where other species have looked up and seen the stars, the Bobo only saw their Veil. Its nature, especially by the time of space flight became the trigger for a series of global conflicts that eventually resolved through publication of discoveries from beyond the Veil and would bring the Bobo in an era of unity and peace."

 origin_akeean:0 "Shielded"
 origin_akeean_desc:0 "This civilization developed under the protection of an ancient planetary shield, named the Veil by the population. With the shield fading, it is now free to explore the galaxy."
 origin_tooltip_akeean_effects:1 "Homeworld is enveloped by a §YPlanetary Shield§!. Investigating the nature of this shield and why it is deteriorating, may lead to powerful outcomes for this empire. Perhaps the galaxy was protected for millennia from what was §Rkept behind this shield§!?"
 START_SCREEN_AKEEAN:0 "For what might have been millennia, when our ancestors looked towards the night sky, they would see no stars. Only the glow of the Veil that would define the limits of our existence.\n\nPhilosophers of old argued that the green sky might delineate the realm of mortals from the realm of the gods. For a long time our species lived in certainty that [GetHomeWorldName] would be all we'd ever have.\n\nEventually our best minds discovered that the barrier was waning, enough to let us carefully launch orbital craft through ever shifting weak points.\n\nEven though we do not fully understand this barrier surrounding our world yet, we reach for what lies beyond."

 d_akeean_moonbase_replicator_desc:0 "This ancient machine is nestled deep within the moon's interior, built into its main reactor from where it also draws its power. A relic of whomever originally built this secret base, its matter replication technology is utterly incomprehensible to us."
 akeean_shield_active:0 "Planetary Shield"
 akeean_shield_active_desc:0 "An impenetrable Planetary Shield surrounds this World.\n\nIn ever shifting locations, parts of the shield may become permeable for spacecrafts and other objects to pass through from either side.\n\nOrbital bombardment and unwelcome landing craft will have a very hard time making it to the surface of this Planet. There is also a benefit to agriculture due to a slight greenhouse effect."

 site_akeean_intro:0 "This moon is a symbol to our species.\n\nSince the shield strongly interfered with visibility to outer space, most of the early space missions that managed to break through the shield ended up here.\n\nUnlike early missions to beyond the Veil, chances for a successful return are no longer zero.\n\nOur survey teams have landed on the Moon on a site originally prepared for observation of our Galaxy but quickly became of interest when it became obvious that the Moon itself interfered with sensitive electronic devices.\n\nIt is now time to find the origin of this interference."
 origin_akeean.1200.name:0 "Beyond the green Veil."
 origin_akeean.1200.desc:0 "The first team quickly discovered trails of radiation leading to especially large craters. We assumed they were caused by asteroids but our knowledge about them and their impact is very limited, thanks to the Veil protecting our Homeworld. But even with the minimum knowledge we could see that something was amiss.\n\nThe only thing we could compare the size and destruction to were fission weapons of mass destruction used in a time of experimentations during the Machine Ages. But even then, these craters were much older and larger.\n\nWith the investigation of the craters origin still ongoing, our team discovered a shaft near a ravine in the periphery of the crater."

 origin_akeean.1205.desc:0 "It did not take much effort for our specialists to descend into the opening.\n\nWhat appeared to be some sort of large, artificially made thermal exhaust port, eventually opened up into a network of tunnels.\n\nSeismic-acoustic probing confirmed that these tunnels lead deep inside the Moon and form a massive hollow volume.\n\nAs it turns out, this is no ordinary moon. It is a massive rock scaffolding dressed up as a moon and houses a large artificial habitat in its center."
 origin_akeean.1205.a:0 "Explore the Complex."
 origin_akeean.1210.name:0 "Keymasters sentry"
 origin_akeean.1210.desc:0 "Deep within the habitat lies what must have been a city-sized research and observation complex.\n\nOur teams have found internal diagrams of the complex and confirmed that the peculiar impact craters used to be emplacements for sensitive surveillance equipment that targeted our Homeworld.\n\nThe reason for their destruction remains unknown.\n\nWhile there is neither a trace of inhabitants or any signs of a violent struggle or calamity befalling it, the complex appears powered and our teams have found an active terminal to attempt a full reactivation."

 origin_akeean.1215.name:0 "Memories from beyond the Veil"
 origin_akeean.1215.desc:0 "A recording of higher priority plays back first, dated during a time of strife after we first passed through the Veil. In that time a global war was fought on the surface, no further missions were sent towards space.\n\nThe Moon bases sensors are focused on what appears to be a fleet of menacing looking ships that arrived in our system and bombarded first the shield around our world to little effect, then turning around and leaving the orbit of our Homeworld. Almost as an afterthought they let go of a few missiles that hit the exposed sensor equipment on the Moon on their way out of the system and thus ended any chance of further observation.\n\nIt does not appear that anyone boarded the underground research complex after it was blinded and after that the fleet must have simply left the system again.\n\nEarlier and far more extensive observation logs are available as a compiled archive."

 origin_akeean.1220.desc:0 "Whoever manned the research outpost on our Moon had deep insight into our species progression over several decades.\n\nWhile only the more recent logs could be accessed, these archives date back to the beginning of our Machine Age.\n\nCertain events had been closely watched, like the many failed attempts to launch spacecraft beyond the Veil. Not only could and did the observers record the spectacular annihilation of our rockets at the impermeable shield, they also collected the global media of our collective hope, grief and coping with these failures. When our ancestors attempted to use fission warheads against the shield, which caused near near global effects in the movement and appearance of the shield, this too had been recorded in minute detail.\n\nThe first time one of our vehicles passed beyond the Veil, thanks to our new accomplishments in observation of the shield, it has a particular place among the recordings.\n\nIt seems the station had been ordered to evacuate soon after. The surveillance from then on recorded only coincidental parts of the prelude of war on the surface and was blinded months after by the rampaging fleet."

 origin_akeean.1230.desc:0 "Our team has made a breakthrough discovery in the control center of the moonbase.\n\nThe Moonbase contains a device which can reabsorb the shield around our homeworld and recover its energy. With some energy expense it is possible recreate the shield as needed.\n\nNow it is for us to choose if we remain behind the Veil."
