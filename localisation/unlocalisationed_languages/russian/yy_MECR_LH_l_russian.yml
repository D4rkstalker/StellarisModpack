 MECR_LH.1001.title: "Form the House of Representatives"
 MECR_LH.1001.desc: "Recently, political activists from many weaker empires are gathering. They claim that the Senate of [GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] is nominally a platform for equal game among all empires in the galaxy, but it is actually a hunting ground for the strong and the law of the jungle. Galaxy needs a truly fair and democratic consultation mechanism - a political platform parallel to the Senate, that's the House of Representatives.\nThe house of Representatives implements the one country one vote system, only the members of [GetGalCouncilOrImpCouncil] were granted an additional vote.\nThe organizers stressed that unlike the Senate, which has become a platform for those huge empires to seize benefits, the house of representatives will focus on formulating resolutions to promote the development of galaxy.\nShould we support their proposal?"
