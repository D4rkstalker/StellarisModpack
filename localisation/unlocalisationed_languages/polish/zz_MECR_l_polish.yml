 MECR.322.1.h.desc: "Our research shows that some abnormal behaviors of §H[operation_disrupt_1_target_empire.GetName]§! in recent days are caused by the thought conflict in the neural network caused by the dissatisfaction of the hive mind with the imperium. If we help them to build a secondary swarm isolated from the main brain in remote colonies, they can organize resistance activities under the eyes of the imperium."
 MECR.322.1.m.desc: "Our survey shows that the Imperium is strengthening its control over the machine intelligence of §H[operation_disrupt_1_target_empire.GetName]§!, in case of its resistance to the rule of [galactic_emperor.GetName]. If we help them to build a drone network partially isolated from the central intelligence in remote colonies, they can organize resistance activities under the eyes of the imperium."
 MECR.322.2.desc: "We know that the ideas of opposing imperial rule are spreading in the intellectual class of §H[operation_disrupt_2_target_empire_empire.GetName]§! secretly. If we can provide a hidden and extensive dissemination channel for their ideas, the trend of thought of resistance will plant seeds in the hearts of the public."
 MECR.322.3.desc: "There is an obvious security loophole in the government of the [galactic_emperor.capital.GetName] that has not been repaired. After all, who dares to make trouble in the heart of the imperium? They will soon pay for their arrogance, our agents are ready to hack into the imperial file system."
 MECR.322.3.h.desc: "A major management node on [galactic_emperor.capital.GetName] exchanged governance information with its subordinate provinces through a leaky network. If we can hack into it and tamper with the figures on some files, we can mislead the imperium to make wrong decisions."
 MECR.322.3.m.desc: "There is a hidden and fatal bug in the management system on [galactic_emperor.capital.GetName], which is a blind spot caused by the difference between the thinking mode of the imperial machine intelligence and ours.

 MECR.322.5.h.desc: "Our agents found that a §H[galactic_emperor.GetSpeciesName]§! handling important information for the Imperial Security Directorate used a large number of non-standard nerve implants. If we quietly replace some of them with our version, the drone can become our eyes and ears in the ISD, thus greatly reducing the risk of spying in this area."
 MECR.322.5.m.desc: "Our hacker found that the conversion protocol used by a §H[galactic_emperor.GetSpeciesName]§! drone handling important information for the Imperial Security Directorate to communicate with provincial subordinates was quite strange. If we can break this protocol, the drone will deliver theISD's action plan in the region to us word for word, thus greatly reducing the risk of espionage activities."
 MECR.322.6.desc: "Where there is power, there will be greed. A senior manager in charge of the regional strategic storage of the empire coveted the huge wealth he managed.

Once the uprising begins, resistance groups will rush out of the ground and take back their homes."
 MECR.323.1.h.desc: "After our operatives managed to make §H[operation_disrupt_1_target_empire.GetName]§! aware of our activities, [operation_disrupt_1_target_empire.GetRulerName] sent a secret synapse drone to contact us.
