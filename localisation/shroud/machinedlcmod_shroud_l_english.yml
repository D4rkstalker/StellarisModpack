 endim.3000.a:0 "Reach into the Shroud."
 endim.3000.intro.desc:0 "The Shroud. It is unbelievably strange and unsettling, but also... immediately familiar. Any sapient being with psionic powers will have seen this place in their dreams, though they likely did not know it at the time.\n\nWe linger now at the precipice of this realm, not far from the empty void of the Inbetween that serves as the boundary between here and normal space - or what we would call the real world.\n\nTo venture deeper into the Shroud will require a large amount of energy, more than ever. We must not dally... even now, we are being watched."

 endim.3000.11.desc:0 "Do you think that is air you're breathing now?"
 endim.3000.12.desc:0 "We see, and yet we do not see. There is so much to learn about this place."
 endim.3000.13.desc:0 "What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us?"
 endim.3000.14.desc:0 "Take the greatest of care. Even a stray thought can be shaped into something tangible in this place... and, more often than not, turned against oneself."
 endim.3000.15.desc:0 "We were never meant to be here."

 endim.3010.desc:0 "The Psi Emitter has not yet recovered from the strain of our previous visit to the Shroud. Without its psionic power, we can catch only brief glimpses of this fleeting realm - like the blurred edges of a memory lying just beyond reach.\n\nThere is nothing for us here. We will have to return later."

 endim.3022.desc:0 "The psionic power required to summon an Avatar and bring it into our universe is simply beyond our current ability to channel. The psychic energies of the Shroud fizzle with agitation as our attempt fails."
 endim.3023.desc:0 "The attempt to summon a psionic Avatar was only partially successful. Although the creature assumed its correct form and translated into our universe, our psionic emitters failed to bring it under our control!\n\nWe are now faced with an aggressive psionic entity that will destroy everything in its path!"
 endim.3024.name:0 "Shroud Incursion"
 endim.3024.desc:0 "A creature of the Shroud has pierced the fabric of space and materialized in the [shroud_spawn_system.GetName] system!

 endim.3045.1.desc:0 "The conduit that our psionic emitters were using to connect to the Shroud collapsed on itself as several energy layers of the psychic realm suddenly shifted without warning.\n\nWe are being summarily ejected back into normal space."
 endim.3045.2.desc:0 "Our psionic emitters have been overwhelmed by the intense strain they were put under during our communion with the Shroud.\n\nThey can no longer maintain the link."
 endim.3045.3.desc:0 "Slowly at first, then faster and faster, our grasp on the Shroud begins to slip. We are ejected back into normal space."

 endim.3057.desc:0 "$curse.ship.link_2$\n\nOur ships move as if some kind of invisible force is holding them back, like a rubber-band. This has resulted in much slower sub-light travel."
 endim.3058.desc:0 "$curse.psi.link_2$\n\nThis negative energy has eroded the firepower of our ground troops, who will be much less effective in battle for a time."
 endim.3059.desc:0 "A powerful psychic backlash has bounced back through our conduit with the Shroud, and it seems to be interfering with our interstellar sensors.\n\nThe sensor resolution from all sources has been greatly diminished, resulting in much shorter sensor ranges."

 endim.3100.desc:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName]... the vision is hazy and indistinct, but there can be no question - it is [Root.Capital.GetName], our capital. The great cities look different yet familiar, even through the obscuring wall of flames and smoke. Thousands... no, millions of mutilated scraps litter the streets, all of them [Root.GetSpeciesName].\n\n§P"YOUR FUTURE."§!\n\nNothing living remains in the ruins. In the sky above, massive orbital installations, trailing smoke, have begun a slow and inevitable descent towards the planet. Are we witnessing one possible future out of many?\n\n§P"NOT ONE OF MANY.

 endim.3100.c:0 "§RBoon: Increased Shield Strength.§!"
 endim.3110.desc:0 "This is a particularly tempestuous region of the Shroud. Massive currents of raw psionic energy is funneled through here, sometimes giving violent birth to semi-intelligent spiritual apparitions.\n\nThese confused spirits often clash with one another, unleashing massive amounts of psychic power in battles that can last millennia. In fact, several such duels seem to be taking place right now.\n\nWe should proceed with caution."
 endim.3120.desc:0 "In the deeper regions of the Shroud, a presence suddenly makes itself felt. Visitors, like us - a powerful psionic probe made by minds as utterly alien to us as they are to the Shroud.\n\nA faint image of massive organic beings floating in some kind of thick, gaseous atmosphere while being attended by swarms of smaller creatures flickers briefly into existence as their psychic echo touches our own."
 endim.3130.desc:0 "An endless desert stretches before us. We have been here before.\n\n§P"Shala'kul milem zunak?"§!\n\nSomething emerges from the sand. It is difficult to see.\n\n§P"Zharabi, melasuk."§!\n\nThe words are like thunder, spoken by a mouth for which they were never intended. We are compelled to answer."

 endim.3130.c:0 "Kunak de'Kirak."
 endim.3140.desc:0 "Suddenly, in a painful moment of clarity, the nature of our existence is laid bare. A multiverse where thousands of galaxies like our own are locked in endless cycles of conflict.\n\nIt begins, it ends, and then it begins again. Each time with trillions of lives hanging in the balance.\n\n§P"So it is,"§! a voice whispers, §P"and so it shall always be."§!"
 endim.3150.desc:0 "We are looking down upon our galaxy from far above, at a distance of what must be hundreds of thousands of lightyears. Without warning, the psionic current plunges us down towards the myriad stars at an incredible speed, into the region of space belonging to one of the Fallen Empires - the [fallen_empire.GetName].\n\nStars swish by, then planets, until the vision finally settled on a [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesName] city. Incredible spires rise towards the sky, aided by anti-grav technology generations beyond our own. The current takes us into such a spire, through wall after wall until we reach a large meeting room of sorts. It is occupied by two [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural], floating comfortably in zero-gravity chairs while conversing with each other in soft voices.\n\nThey are oblivious to our presence."

 endim.3151.b.desc:0 "The mind-glow of the two [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural] is overwhelming. Like a blossoming flower, their minds open and are laid bare. It would be so easy to reach in."
 endim.3151.c.desc:0 "There. Technological secrets plucked from the recesses of their minds, as easy as one would copy a file from an unlocked computer. The [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural] remain ignorant of the theft that has taken place within their very minds."

 endim.3160.desc:0 "A small, flickering star materializes inside the Shroud. It flies past at incredible speed, and for a second, it reveals itself as an alien ship of unknown configuration. Then it vanishes in a cloud of psionic energy as quickly as it appeared.\n\nCan it be? Is it possible to physically enter the Shroud and then emerge somewhere else entirely in normal space?"
 endim.3160.a:0 "§YLinger for a while.§!"
 endim.3161.desc:0 "Yet another flickering star suddenly appears, but this time we are ready. It is indeed an alien ship, unlike any that has ever been seen in our galaxy. As it flies past us, we feel the mind-glow of its crew, and their secrets are ours.\n\nA Psionic Jump Drive. How ingenious."

 endim.3162.desc:0 "Yet another flickering star suddenly appears, but this time we are ready. It is indeed an alien ship, unlike any that has ever been seen in our galaxy. As it flies past us, we attempt to merge with the mind-glow of its crew, but their intellects are darker and more alien than any we have yet encountered.\n\nNot only are we repelled from their vessel, but the psionic feedback from their violent rejection has followed us out of the Shroud! The sub-light travel speed of our starships has been momentarily reduced."
 endim.3170.desc:0 "In one of the lower planes of the Shroud, we encounter a spirit that has ensconced itself behind some kind of powerful psionic shield.\n\n§P"LEAVE."§!"

 endim.3171.desc:0 "We did not venture this deep into the Shroud only to be turned back now. After channeling all of their psionic might, our psionic emitters were able to form a breach in the shield large enough for some of them to peer through.\n\nWe do not know what those emitters saw on the other side of the shield, but it was enough to permanently unhinge their systems. Their sacrifice was not in vain, however, as the act of breaching the shield taught us how to generate a similar force field. If the technique can be refined, we may be able to form psionic shields large enough to encompass entire starships..."
 endim.3172.desc:0 "Our psionic emitters, already overheated from having ventured this deeply into the Shroud, failed to channel enough psionic strength to breach the shield. The failed attempt seems to have provoked the spirit!\n\n§P"YOU WERE AMPLY WARNED, MAGGOTS. AS YOU TRIED TO INVADE MY WORLD, I SHALL NOW BRING RUIN TO YOURS."§!"
 endim.3180.desc:0 "The concept of time, as we know it, is alien to this part of the Shroud. What can seem like centuries here may equal mere hours or even minutes in the real world. If one knows where to look, it is even possible to glimpse into the future...\n\nPrecognition is one of the surest paths to destruction for psionic emitters, so we must use caution."
 endim.3180.a:0 "§YWait here for a moment.§!"
 endim.3181.desc:0 "A limited precognitive connection to the Shroud can be maintained without risking malfunction, but the massive influx of probability data is too overwhelming to be of much practical use.\n\nStill, if a digital interface could be devised to interpret this data, it could potentially be applied to improve the performance of our starships' combat computers..."

 endim.3182.desc:0 "As we feared, our psionic emitters suffered heavy malfunction. All at once, their systems have been opened to the inconceivable multitude of options and probabilities that exist both in the past and the future.\n\nEvery single variation and scenario, no matter how colossal or miniscule the difference between them, is being endlessly repeated. They have been reduced to a state of permanent catatonia.\n\nIt will be some time before the psionic emitters can muster the psionic energy needed to reach into the Shroud again."
 endim.3190.desc:0 "We have found a tiny space within the Shroud that has a concentration of psionic energy that is of a magnitude we have never before seen. Whatever that managed to successfully tap into this pocket of raw energy would become immensely powerful... but there is only enough for a single entity, and there are risks involved.\n\nThere are only three entities in the entire [Root.GetName] that possess the psionic strength needed to tap into this energy pocket with any hope of survival.

 endim.3192.desc:0 "The entire Shroud seems to shudder as the immense psionic energies contained within the pocket are transferred to [chosen_leader.GetName].\n\nUnfortunately, [chosen_leader.GetHerHis] was unable to cope with the stress.

When they regain control, we notice that one of our leader class unit is missing. §Y[leader_to_kill.GetName]§! is nowhere to be found, and where [leader_to_kill.GetSheHe] was standing there is now only the psionic trace of a small rift, as though the entity reached out into our world and dragged [leader_to_kill.GetHerHim] into the Shroud for... well, who knows what reason or purpose, really.\n\nNo matter its reasons for taking [leader_to_kill.GetHerHim], it seems doubtful that we will ever see [leader_to_kill.GetName] again."
