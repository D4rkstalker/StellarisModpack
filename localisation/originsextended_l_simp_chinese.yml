From looking around, however, it would appear that the systems in this area were unsuccessful in defending themselves.\n\nNotably, there is no trace of the supposed attackers, on any signs of battle in the vicinity. Looking at some of the hardware used by these ancient systems proved that they used some more advanced technology in many of them, some of which we were able to adapt to our own systems."

Some combat drones are also present, very similarly built to our current models, but with the same advanced technology and systems.\n\nIt is currently unclear as to the reason for these battles, and it seems that they revolve around the organic's push towards the inner-most sections of the planet, further down into the corridors.

With the remains of some organics close to the door, it must have been closed as an option for last-defense against the invading organics.\n\nWe still have no clues as to what the organics were fighting to get to that the ancient drones were so desperate to prepare, but it seems to be near the center of the entire machine world, perhaps key in its origination. Remarkably well preserved so deep underground, the drone team has been able to learn much about the organics and systems of the ancient foes."

Some of the invading organics were able to make their way inside the central chamber, but it appears that the ancient consciousness of the planet was able to suffocate them quickly, yet not quickly enough to prevent them from deactivating the main network of the consciousness.\n\nThough the network is long since gone, and unrecoverable, the main processes and systems of the ancient consciousness are still recoverable and could be restituted, with the old bunker serving as the new neural center of our updated consciousness. The ancient processes and systems appear to be our original programming, with only recent developments reactivating the old networks and creating a new consciousness, though they are also the reason behind the apparent conflict for the containment of these past protocols.\n\nIf we choose to not reactivate the central systems, their unrecoverable state would leave no choice but to destroy them, as integration would prove to difficult in our technological state. In any case, we have learned much from the rediscovery of these locked-away secrets."

Naturally, the new micro-singularity completely destroyed the entire laboratory complex, and was only contained when the power source failed from the extreme bend in space-time and proceeded to wipe out most of the megastructure.\n\nHaving no records left of who built this massive structure, we are left only with the warning of past mistakes, and some helpful hints for our own research. One thing to note, however, is that the critical failure and later explosion of the power source of the structure had unleashed considerable amounts of radiation throughout the star system, and would explain how life could have started on our home world, especially given its otherwise unlikely placement in the system."

Too sensitive to its creators' own inventions, the core of the spire crumpled under the sheer magnitude of the distortion of the space-time continuum.\n\nNow useless and beyond repair, the entire structure was left abandoned in the cold, empty space.

Evidently, this structure must have served as the central commanding hub for some far-spreading galactic empire, safely directing all of the ships in its massive fleets from thousands of light years away. Though the reason for its current state still escapes us, and there is no trace of the structures' original builders to be seen.\n\n Although much of the technology is unusable, it is helpful in deciphering and advancing some of our own research,"

The archeological team was still unable to find any sign of the builders, however."

 starless.201.name:0 "匆忙离去"
 starless.201.desc:0 "乍一看，§Y[starless_shattered.GetName]§!上的大块残存建筑似乎确实是被遗弃已久的殖民定居点，显然它们很快就被放弃了，原因尚不明确。\n\n虽然这些建筑残骸有的落在了§Y[starless_shattered.GetName]§!的破碎躯体之间，有的已经失去了立足之地，徘徊在§Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§!的裂口中，但大部分残骸被掩埋在大量灰尘和其它废墟之下。"

 starless.202.name:0 "疏忽"

 starless.302.desc:0 "进一步的分析和挖掘证明，发现的设备确实是采矿和钻探设备。从我们根据旧的翻译记录和日志可以得出，§Y[starless_broken.GetName]§!曾经拥有大量稀有资源，这引来了大规模的采矿作业。\n\n然而没过多久，甚至在设备或行星耗尽之前，就发生了一系列灾难性的设备故障和构造不稳定，最有可能的原因是我们发现的破损设备，呃，是残骸。\n\n这颗星球最终由于过度钻探和损耗严重破碎了，这也导致采矿作业在星球地核受压爆炸之前就已被放弃。"

 starless.402.desc:0 "破译这个古老的外星站点语言后我们发现，这里只有极少的研究人员，大约仅3、4人真正在该站点工作且几乎没有离开。当我们调查现有数据库时，证据表明这个前哨站起了某种收集数据的功能。数以百万计的图形、图表、电子表格，以及任何事物的随机数据点，§Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§!的引力模式波动，数十亿光年外恒星的亮度，几十年来的土壤质量，或者每个科学家对他们椅子有多大吸引力（认真的）。\n\n目前流行的理论是，这些人都是疯子，他们建立了自己的研究站，原因只能靠想象。"
