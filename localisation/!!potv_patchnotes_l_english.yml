 potv_desc: "Latest Update Date: 05/12/2019\n\nThis Patch includes:\nGeneral:\n - Fixed early-mid game lag! So, it seems that having empty ethic points in countries creates void of daily lag! I have solved this by ensuring that every country gets a faith type at the begining of the game and added a simple check every month to ensure it (in case new countries show up, since we got no On_country_created action/events). Im not fond of the idea of adding monthly checkers, but in this case its necesary. If lag persists do not hessitate to contact me!\nYou can manualy force this by using 'event potv_religions.1'\n- Fixed an issue where some players had their games global event country destroyed and constantly got this popup\n\nLocalisation:\n- §RAdded localisation for policies, opinion modifiers and decisions§!\n- Replaced Deism with Monotheism\n- Added localisation for heretics\n- Fixed some typos\n\nGameplay:\n- §RAdded missing functionality to Religious Conditioning§!\nHerecy threshold divided by 2, now you get a heretic every 5 pops, maximum is still 10"
