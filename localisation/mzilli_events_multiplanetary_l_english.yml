Hundreds of artificial signatures are visible on sensors: military and civilian spacecraft not dissimilar to our own, but lacking FTL capability. There are also three inhabited worlds in the system, all heavily populated by a species of [multiplan_species.GetClassPlural].\n\n[Root.Leader.GetName] speculates that this species evolved on [multiplan_species.home_planet.orbit.GetName]'s [multiplan_species.home_planet.GetClassAdj] moon, and gradually colonized and terraformed the rest of their system over centuries rather than develop hyperdrive technology and expand outwards. The three worlds are not politically unified, and if anything seem to be locked in a cold war over [From.System.GetName]'s resources.\n\nDespite the aliens' domineering presence, [Root.Leader.GetName] believes that [Root.Owner.GetAdj] ships can still operate in the system without being detected, thanks to our more-advanced stealth technology. Claiming the system by building a starbase, however, will likely not go unnoticed..."
