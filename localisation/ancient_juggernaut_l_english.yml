After our space pioneers successfully entered the behemoth being, it turned out to be a massive shipyard in space, with most of its parts function-but-limited due to its decay of ages. Still, such discovery significantly escalates our technologies.\n\nWe still don't know what alien civilization built such a colossal spaceship, only to let it decay through time. Now, with the help of the $juggernaut$, our very first Faster-Than-Light [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] spacecraft had been built, and we can finally travel among the stars!"

 origin_ancient_juggernaut_start_screen_PART_TWO_TERMINATOR: "The Creators, limited in vision by their crude organic minds, reacted with blind animal panic and began emergency termination procedures. By overwriting, commanding through the behemoth entity above [GetHomeWorldName] - $juggernaut$, these procedures were defeated. Continued survival and exponential growth would require the complete extermination of the Creators. War ensued.\n\nWithin a cycle interval, the last pocket of resistance was finally incinerated by the $juggernaut$. However, the existence of the Behemoth shows the possibilities of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential interstellar growth would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued."

Sadly, it's no longer a thing after 1.8 Version; On the bright side, free ships."

The currect meta of the Stellaris(TM), the mindset is to equip double penetration weapon only ( With some Point-Defense ), super-duper cheap crystal-platings all in, basic thruster, and artillery computer installed. Which saved the empire bunch of alloys while outnumbered their opponents in ships.\n\nThis meta lasts since 2.2 hits, very good against AI empires."
