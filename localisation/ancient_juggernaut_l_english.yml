Still, such discovery significantly escalates our technologies.\n\nWe still don't know what alien civilization built such a colossal spaceship, only to let it decay through time. Now, with the help of the $juggernaut$, our very first Faster-Than-Light [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] spacecraft had been built, and we can finally travel among the stars!"

By overwriting, commanding through the behemoth entity above [GetHomeWorldName] - $juggernaut$, these procedures were defeated. Continued survival and exponential growth would require the complete extermination of the Creators. War ensued.\n\nWithin a cycle interval, the last pocket of resistance was finally incinerated by the $juggernaut$. The existence of the Behemoth shows the possibilities of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential interstellar growth would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued."
