# Proletarian Traders
PT_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "What tragedies take place within each circling space of years! And it is a tragedy that despotic hegemons such as the [From.GetName] exist in the first place."
PT_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Do not underestimate us, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. There are many that have underestimated the [Root.GetName] and suffered because of it."
PT_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The will of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] citizens are clear: the [From.GetName] are a bunch of greedy, backstabbing bastards. We will tolerate no transgressions from your kind."
PT_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] shall stand eternal, for all time. It is our fate, our destiny. You, the [From.GetName] on the other hand, are like scurrying pathetic little [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s, who will vanish one day into the history books."
PT_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "In our history we have always been strong. Never have we lacked heroes. We are not to be trifled with, dear [From.GetSpeciesName]."
PT_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "It is our eternal right to fight for our sovereignty. If you remember that, our relations will be friendly and cordial."
PT_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Remember, [From.GetSpeciesName], we can easily be friends just as we can easily be enemies. We are fine with having another good neighbor around, but we are not reluctant to fight and defend ourselves if necessary. Keep that in mind."
PT_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Just as a warning - we will not be pushed around by aggressors such as the [From.GetName]. Do not underestimate the power of labour!"
PT_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We are glad to call the [From.GetName] our good friends. Sometimes, its good to have a true friend that can be trusted."
PT_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "It is always a pleasure to meet with representatives from the [From.GetName]. Together, we can protect our respective homeworlds against any threat the galaxy might throw at us!"
PT_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Though a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] worker's first priority is to protect the [Root.GetName], his second is to protect our friends, the [From.GetName]."
PT_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "How dare you [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s try to invade our land? Your armies, without pity, will be annihilated."
PT_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Even if you were to have more guns, more soldiers, more victories, that would not matter. We will win in the end."
PT_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] has fought [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s tougher than you."
# Vassal greetings
PT_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We would rather die as your lowly servants than live as unfaithful lords."
PT_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "We have endured worse tyrants than the [From.GetSpeciesName]. Your time will come, one day."
# Declaration of War
PT_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Your aggressions can no longer be ignored. We must now defend ourselves against the capitalistic, colonizing bastards who call themselves the [From.GetName]."


# Elitist Snobs
ES_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Who are you to speak to us? Speaking to our inferiors as if we were equals.... Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting."
ES_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Why do we have to mix and socialize with working class scum in the name of diplomacy?"
ES_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Seeing [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] makes me feel like I've lost some of my inherent superiority already. Very well, get on with it. What drivel do you wish to discuss with us?"
ES_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Speaking to dirty peasants is a waste of time, yet here we are. What do you want?"
ES_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "It seems that the [From.GetName] does not know the natural hierarchy of things. Would you like us to teach you? It would require you serving us, but that is only right and proper, after all."
ES_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is nothing but an entire nation of working class scum."
ES_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Your leaders hardly deserve to be called leaders, so weak and inferior is your nation. What accomplishments do you have to your name, compared to our glorious heritage? None."
ES_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We hope your nation is ruled by the betters of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] society, and not its working class scum."
ES_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation of the highest elegance and class. We do not mix with our inferiors - on the contrary, we shun them, as is our innate right."
ES_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "It is our natural privilege to lord over those we consider our inferiors. Our nation is ruled by those born into the superior few who dole out righteous leadership over the inept masses."
ES_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We are merely here to teach everyone there place. Some are born leaders, but most are born followers."
ES_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "There is a natural order to the universe, and in this natural order, the many will always be led by a few."
ES_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We are put in a difficult position. How does one explain an inferior society like the [From.GetName] being stronger than [Root.GetName]? A great question. We've been wondering about that ourselves."
ES_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "When our values are under threat by more powerful nations like the [From.GetName], we remember that there is an inherent order to things, that some are naturally more superior and others naturally more inferior, and that we are clearly on the superior side of things."
ES_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Our ruling classes are happy to cooperate with your ruling classes, so long as we mutually benefit. Together, we shall oppress the masses."
ES_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Hail there, good friends from the [From.GetName]! Let us join together in laughing at the miseries of those inferior to us."
ES_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] high culture is quite popular among the elites of the [Root.GetName]. It is clear you understand our values well."
ES_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "You don't want to cause more suffering for your working class scum? What now? Ha! That is a very good joke friend. We both know that is the natural thing for all rulers to do, and within their right. But clearly you're not here to jest. Let us get straight to business! What can we help you with?"
ES_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "There are plenty of inferior yet uppity scum scattered across our universe who think they deserve better. Together, we will work side by side to teach them their place."
ES_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Is there anything nobler than hunting down our inferiors for sport? Inferiors like you are nothing but prey to our superior, predatory instincts."
ES_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We enjoy a good war every now and then. It allows us to pacify the masses and teach them why we rule them in the first place."
ES_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Let us show the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] the true way of things - that in this universe, some were born to rule, and others to grovel at their feet, and we are without doubt the former."
# Vassal greetings
ES_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our superiors from the [From.GetName]. How shall we oppress both [From.GetSpeciesAdj] and [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] working class scum today?"
ES_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "It is tragic that we must take orders from the likes of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Mark our words - we do not forget our humiliations, and when we become powerful once more, you shall be taught your place!"
# Declaration of War
ES_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! In the natural order of things, there are those that must perish to make way for their superiors. There is no more time for diplomacy. Instead, let us see who is the better!"

 # Preservationists
 PR_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The behavior of the [From.GetName] is an affront to the galactic community. In your greed for power and riches, it seems to us that you are incapable of showing restraint and respecting the natural way of things."
 PR_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is wary of your constant meddling in the natural order of things. There is no shame in upholding the balance of the galaxy through force, but your interventionism is a danger to all, including yourselves."
 PR_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Have you no respect for the natural order of things? The [From.GetName] seems unconcerned for protecting the environment and the right for every sentient species to exist."
 PR_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "So long as you keep to yourselves and do not contest our dedication to a galaxy where nature is respected we shall pose no threat to you. But we doubt you would be able to do much to us."
 PR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] prefers not to get involved in others' affairs. So long as you do not disturb our peace, then we can avoid conflict."
 PR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "As every sentient species has a right to live by its normal cultural evolution, no [Root.GetSpeciesName] may interfere with the healthy development of nature and culture. We see the deterioration or destruction of the environment and natures as an insult to our peace."
 PR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Every world is defined by its particular boundaries, within which some understanding of reality emerges as truth. Two truths cannot coexist, and so from the introduction of foreign bodies is conflict and chaos spawns. That's why we limit our involvement in local affairs."
 PR_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Might and influence might be yours, [From.GetSpeciesName], but remember not to be tempted by the lure of power. We believe it is still your moral necessity that you do not disturb the natural way of things."
 PR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friend, we are glad that you agree with our views. It is difficult trying to ensure everyone in the galaxy respects the sovereignty of every species and takes care not to disturb the delicate balance of the galaxy's ecosystem."
 PR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy's ecological diversity is, in a sense, sacred. As we are all in a sense connected, it is imperative that our two peoples work together to protect it from crimes against nature."
 PR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] believes that the galaxy's diverse ecology is worth protecting and the sovereign right of every sentient species to develop at its own pace."
 PR_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Do not believe for a moment that our soldiers are weak because we love nature. Quite the contrary, we fight for something greater than ourselves."
 PR_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We do not believe war is enjoyable, nor is it desirable, but every [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] soldier knows that they are fighting for a higher cause."
 PR_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "After this war is over, we hope you will come to your senses and stop your needless meddling in the natural ecosystems."
 # Vassal greetings
 PR_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "So long as you respect our ways, to keep the balance of nature, we see no problem with serving you."
 PR_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "The [From.GetName] becomes a bigger threat to the sanctity of the galaxy every day. If you fail to respect the natural laws of the universe, we will have no choice but to reenge on our current agreements, and break any relationship we have with each other."
 # Declaration of War
 PR_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have for too long engaged in wanton crimes against nature, upsetting the balance of the galaxy. That stops today."
