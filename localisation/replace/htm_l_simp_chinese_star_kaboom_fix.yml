### This mess is to get around Paradox deciding that fire planet cracker at star = star destroyed
### to make the Nemesis Star-Eater's message go out instead of tying the notification to its specific weapon.
### Everybody confused when this pops up when a Star-Eater is used should thank them and not me,
### I just am working around the things they don't let us change.
###
### I did try my best to make it generic, although there's nothing to be done about the BLARING SIREN
### the message insists on playing.
MESSAGE_STAR_DESTROYED:0 "星系已更改"
MESSAGE_STAR_DESTROYED_DESC:1 "$PLANET|Y$星系发生了恒星级的变化。"
