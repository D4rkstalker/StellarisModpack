Although the slave majority periodically sought to revolt, the ruling cabal could not easily be dislodged, as their resources were simply too huge. However, their greed proved their downfall when the revolution finally succeeded. The planet's new rulers declared a Free Republic in which all Glukzorans would be equal, redistributed wealth, and abolished slavery and other oppressive practices. It was sworn that never again would a Glukzoran tolerate another to be the victim of oppression; indeed, the planet Glukzor was renamed Huriya, 'freedom' in the Glukzor language.\n\nThat was a generation ago. Now, the Glukzorans have finally decoded the secrets of interstellar travel, and are ready to bear the torch of liberty across the galaxy."
