 projcrim_unrest.5.desc: "Despite our best efforts, the afflicted forces on [FromFrom.GetName] have defeated our armies and are now in control of the world. It is vital that we retake control of [FromFrom.GetName] before the world falls to the infected completely. What happens once the world is fully under their control, we do not know, but we fear the worst."
 projcrim_unrest.5.a: "We will get back in control."
 projcrim_unrest.51.name: "Hunt Finished"
 projcrim_unrest.51.desc: "Our attempts at hunting down some of the afflicted populace on [Root.GetName] has finished, though it has not yielded any results. Although a small group of afflicted individuals were found, they managed to evade capture and even caused some injuries to the team."
 projcrim_unrest.51.a: "Unfortunate."
 projcrim_unrest.52.desc: "Our attempts at hunting down some of the afflicted populace on [Root.GetName] has finished, and although quite minor, a small group of afflicted individuals have been caught and placed in a containment centre to prevent the spreading of chaos on the world."
 projcrim_unrest.52.a: "Acceptable."
 projcrim_unrest.53.desc: "Our attempts at hunting down some of the afflicted populace on [Root.GetName] has finished, with quite favourable results. Several groups of afflicted individuals have been apprehended by our forces, and placed in containment centers, meaning the world will hopefully be somewhat more stable."
 projcrim_unrest.53.a: "Good."
 projcrim_unrest.54.desc: "Our attempts at hunting down some of the afflicted populace on [Root.GetName] has finished, with astonishing results. In a show of extreme competence, our forces discovered and apprehended a large group of the infected population, likely meeting to potentially plan their next move. After managing to restrain them, additional forces aided in the containment of the afflicted."
 projcrim.20.name: "The Parasite's Origins"
 projcrim.20.desc: "Our researchers have expressed interest in discovering the source of the signal sent out by the Crimson Throng, hoping to potentially find the source of the parasites and the Throng as a whole. If successful, perhaps our fight against them will will turn to our favour."
 projcrim.20.a: "Interesting."
 projcrim.21.name: "Special Project Completed"
 projcrim.21.desc: "Aftering an extensive analysis of the strange celestial phenomena around [projcrim_origin_chain1.GetName], we have managed to produce an advanced variant of our existing sensors and transceivers, capable of maintaining a stable connection even in the thickest nebulae.\n\nIf the Crimson Throng send out another signal for us to receive, we should be able to track it."
 projcrim.21.a: "Very good."
 projcrim.22.name: "Ancient Array"
 projcrim.22.desc: "We have discovered what we have estimated to be the source of the signal sent out by the Throng, pointing to a gas giant in the [Root.System.GetName] system. We should conduct a closer investigation of the world if we wish to discover something."
 projcrim.22.a: "Interesting."
 projcrim.23.name: "Planetary Stations"
 projcrim.23.desc: "Deep within the gaseous atmosphere, we have discovered a large array of orbital stations. On approaching them, the entrance to the interior remains blocked off, and some of the stations seem to host an arcane security system to ward off intruders.\n\nDue to the scale of these defences, it will be almost impossible to enter a station, without doing something about it first"
 projcrim.23.a: "Hack the systems."
 projcrim.23.b: "Prepare a landing army."
 projcrim.24.name: "Infiltrating the Array"
 projcrim.24.desc: "Our armed forces have managed to break their way into the stations orbiting the gas giant closely, successfully neutralising the automated defences around the stations, with minimal casualties.\n\nUnfortunately, whether due to some sort of self-destruction sequence or due to our forces' destruction, much of the data within the computers of the stations was destroyed. Acting quickly, small amounts of information could be gathered by our researchers before it was wiped.\n\nThough much of it is unintelligible or useless without other data, there are many references to a certain uncharted star system.\n\nThe co-ordinates of this system were pieced together, and is marked in the Situation Log."
 projcrim.24.a: "Let's have a look."
 projcrim_origin_chain3: "The Benefactors"
 projcrim_origin_chain3_desc: "The co-ordinates of a strange and unknown star system were uncovered from within the orbital stations of a gas giant. How this relates to the Crimson Throng is still unknown, but the system is said to be controlled by a mysterious faction referred to as 'The Benefactors'."
 projcrim.26.name: "The Benefactors"
 projcrim.26.desc: "The systems controlling the orbital defences were successfully disabled, allowing our researchers to delve deeper into the stations.\n\nMuch to our dismay, much of the data stored in the systems have been expunged, and what little remained made little to no sense on its own. Closer analysis has, however, allowed us to discover the co-ordinates of an uncharted star system, apparently belonging to a faction referred to as 'The Benefactors'.\n\nSome other data also suggests that this station array is used as a relay, likely used by the Throng in their signal too; there are other relay arrays throughout the galaxy like this one."
 projcrim.26.a: "Intriguing."
 projcrim.27.name: "The Benefactors"
 projcrim.27.desc: "As our forces enter [From.GetName], initial scans of the planets in the system show signs of derelict buildings both on the surface and in orbit of the worlds. The amount of debris and rubble is immense, blocking us from scanning what is below.\n\nHowever, in the system, there lies a shattered world of some kind, perhaps it will reveal some secrets?"
 projcrim.27.a: "Let's have a look."
 projcrim.28.name: "Shattered World Surveyed"
 projcrim.28.desc: "Our exploration team has completed their study and surveying of [projcrim_benefactors_homeworld.GetName] after landing on the shards of the splintered world. Considering the current state of the planet, our researchers were surprised by the data they uncovered.\n\nThough not much is known, an ancient alien race clearly inhabited [projcrim_benefactors_homeworld.GetName], seemingly able to use extremely advanced technology, as seen on the orbital arrays studied previously. We expect them to have once been a galactic superpower, their empire spanning much of the galaxy.\n\nSeveral references are also made to something called the 'Scarlet Project', though what this actually refers to is a mystery. All we managed to uncover about it is the involvement of another race of aliens."
 projcrim.28.a: "How curious."
 projcrim.30.name: "The Signal"
 projcrim.30.desc: "With both projects about the Crimson Throng and their signal's origins, we are now more proficient in detecting signals and disturbances in space.\n\nIn fact, a very minor, almost unnoticeable transmission was detected, seemingly originating from a different source from last time. Despite this, we expect this to be from the Crimson Throng."
 projcrim.30.a: "Onscreen."
 projcrim.32.name: "The Signal"
 projcrim.32.desc: "Yet another signal was picked up earlier today by our scientists, and despite the unknown nature of the transmission, we expect it to have yet again been sent from the Crimson Throng.\n\nThe signal is much cleaner and easier to maintain a solid connection with, thanks to changes in our technology."
