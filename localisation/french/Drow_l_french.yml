d_elven_planetary_cheel_xsaus_desc:0 "Ancient ruins that predate the Event. Presumably this was once a city of some importance, but whatever significance it had has long ago been forgotten. The ruins are particular infamous due to a disturbing fact: no person, ship, probe, or anything sent within the bounds of the ruins ever returns. Modern attempts included long range bombardment only to have no apparent affect. Whatever force exists in these ruins is beyond current understanding."

d_elven_planetary_murrpau_sanguine_desc:0 "Furred parasitic quadrupeds with the ability of flight, even a newborn Murrpau can be lethal. Fortunately they are both solitary and limit their hunting periods to low light conditions. Though they will feed off the blood of nearly anything, tests have conclusively shown they have a preference for the blood of sentient beings. To date, no explanation for this phenomena has been forthcoming."

d_elven_planetary_zhevalshath_blocker:0 "Zhevalshath"
d_elven_planetary_zhevalshath_blocker_desc:0 "In times past, only the strongest of rulers could lay claim to Zhevalshath and keep it.

d_elven_planetary_zhevalshath_desc:0 "More fortress than palace, Zevalshath was traditionally the seat of the most powerful rulers in all of the world. Masssive obsidian walls manage to intimidate whether approached by foot or by sky. Those same walls are now lined with modern defense weaponry are sure to dissuade anyone from attacking. For the first time in its long history, it now houses the seat of a ruler that not only covers all of the planet but also the stars themselves."

d_drow_planetary_cheel_phalar_blocker_desc:0 "Vast portions of this world are covered with spiring arcologies full of dead remains. Explorers report odd occurrences when surveying. Abnormal equipment failure. Sounds of creatures laughing, crying, and even screaming. Our scientists assure us that it nothing more than overactive imaginations. What is quite certain however is that the arcologies are so congested with dead remains they will need to be demolished to even be usable. This will come at a great cost of time and effort."

d_drow_planetary_cheel_phalar_cursed:0 "Curse of the Dead"
d_drow_planetary_cheel_phalar_cursed_desc:0 "Dismantling the arcologies full of alien remains was an arduous task. The frequent equipment failure explained away as normal. Matters are now considerably worse. At first it was persistent power failures for no apparent reason. Then it was the occasional missing colonist. Now entire groups of colonists have vanished. In some cases within minutes of communication. It is clear someone or some thing is behind these events but nothing can ever be established. The situation is so bad that the colony is presently in a perpetual state of terror wondering what can possibly go wrong next."
