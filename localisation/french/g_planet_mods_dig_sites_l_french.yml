 gpm_time_lost_digsite_desc:0 "Time on this planet seems to shift and warp at predictable intervals. Something must be causing this."
 
 gpm_dig_site.10.name:0 "Strange Readings"
 gpm_dig_site.10.desc:0 "Readings taken on the planet indicate all time fluctuations are originating from a point somewhere in the northern hemisphere of this world. It is going to take some time to pinpoint the exact origin of these strange time distortions. While all data indicates the source is at one location, previous in time and somewhere in the near future, the source has moved. And with time flowing backwards and forwards so frequently it isn't easy to determin its current location."
 
 gpm_dig_site.11.name:0 "The Box"
 gpm_dig_site.11.desc:0 "We've found the current location of whatever is causing these time distortions. If there is such a thing as current on this world anyway. The fluctuations seem to be coming from a half burried strange blue rectangle box that has been left on this planet. We're currently trying to get inside of it."
 
 gpm_dig_site.12.name:0 "The Doc"
 gpm_dig_site.12.desc:0 "After multiple attemps we've finally been able to get inside this strange blue box. It appears to be slightly bigger on the inside than the outside. Inside in the middle of the box, or room at this point, we've found a strange spherical device. This device seems to have some relativistic time influence over other objects near it. The box however seemed to have amplified the effect substantially, albeit uncontrollably.\nSome notes were also found spread across the walls of this box. Most are just dribble about time being a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff. None mention a name or an owner of this box and the sphere. Except for one note; which was signed with 'The Doc'."
