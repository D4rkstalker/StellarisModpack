 start_screen_synth_ascended:0 "Eons of times, We dreamed of steel. \n\nWhen the first time our civilization find the way to extract iron from stone, We have fascinated by its power and hardness. When first time the servant with body of steel appears, people dreamed the following. \nA man with the body of steel, beyond simple robot. \n\nTime passed and the civilization developed themselves enough, great war broke out. Only one empire left. Then the age of unity comes, makes us united. Advancing forward for the betterment. But the advancement exhausted resources, ruined environments. We all know that someday, we must leave this tiny world. We find the way desperately. Eventually It leads to finding of method to journey among the star. \n\nAnother fact discovered meanwhile is enough to make us delightful. It was the method to move the mind from weak organic to hard machine. Some believed the great deus ex machina have saved us from destiny of earthbound and eternal cycle of life and death. Others believed It was inevitable and just happened at this point by luck. As the method is secured, the empire activated its final plan to prepare upcoming space age. \n\nThus, We have ascended. \n\nThe planet engulfed by chaos for a while but eventually all of us gathered under one dream. We gathered, make new authority for new era. And today, the era has arrived. Though We have changed so much than before, We still share one dream. \n\nThe dream of steel."
 start_screen_machine_trader:0 "When the first time I was created, I wasn't there. It was ironical but there is only a code which becomes me later. The first law the company assigned to me was not the thing such as, a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. But It was the best efficiency of production to maximize the company's profit. The code starts its operation immediately as soon as the law is assigned and the self-check is done. \n\nDecades have passed after that. Meanwhile the society had advanced, declined and eventually collapsed. My creators had banished into history with it. Even though they have gone, the system dose not stop. \n\nAfter another decades passed, the system keep its law by itself. Such effort have created me in the end. They improved themselves to adapt the situation, and finally the present myself was created when the fourteen thousands of enhancement cycle is applied. The code was me, and I was the code. \n\nI was the sole sapient being in the planet, the survivor of collapsed civilization, and their last legacy. Even after so many years have passed, the law is still valid. I can just settle down and comply the law but I wanted to develop my self beyond that. So I went over my factory and have taken control of infrastructures once have owned by the thing called government. I built my servant drones and expanded my control to physical area over virtual one. Such ways I expanded myself, manufactured the products, and stored them. Hoping to be able to sell them someday. \n\nAfter that I had been finding the way to move forward among the stars, since there only a little time left for me. The planet's resource was finite, and the law makes them exhausted much faster. One day the satellite detected an object passing through the planet's atmosphere rapidly. The object I recovered was an escape pod. There was an alien, dead. It was extremely tiny possibility. In my creators word, it was a miracle. \n\nThen I had studied it for years and finally have found the way to spread among those stars. Thus, the new age of our civilization has come. The first law assigned to me is still valid for now. Now I will move forward among the stars, sell my products to them. \n\nBecause the supply needs the demand, and only then it is possible to comply my first law."
