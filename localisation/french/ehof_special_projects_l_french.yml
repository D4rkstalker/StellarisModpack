  # Description
  INVESTIGATE_CORE_ANOMALY_DESC:0 "The exploration project for the core anomaly of §H[From.GetName]§! was approved, and our best scientists and engineers are now building a construct, which will be able to reach the core anomaly. Then we will be able to reveal its secrets."

  EXPLORE_LARGE_STATION_DESC:0 "Our government approved the exploration project for the damaged space station in the orbit of §H[From.GetName]§!, and our scientists are now preparing an armed exploration team which will investigate the station."

  STUDY_NATURAL_NETWORK_DESC:0 "Our scientists prepare themselves for vast research activity in the forests of §H[From.GetName]§!, in order to find out more about the unique plant genus, that is creating the global network on the planet."

  EXPLORE_ABANDONED_STATION_DESC:0 "Multiple armed exploration teams have been sent out, in order to explore the seemingly abandoned asteroid station.\n\nThey are supposed to determine its initial purpose and look for traces of life, that may not have been detected by our sensors."

  STUDY_PLASMATIC_LIFE_DESC:0 "Direct study of the plasmatic lifeforms has been approved by our government.\n\nReinforced and sheltered units are getting prepared to be deployed within the deadly environment of §H[From.GetName]§!, which can have surface temperatures up to 485° Celsius."

  INVESTIGATE_INTELLIGENT_PLASMATICS_DESC:0 "With governmental approval, our researchers have started an intense and ambitious exploration of §H[From.GetName]§!'s plasmatic ecosystem, to find intelligent plasmatic organisms, potentially capable of social interaction."

  INVESTIGATE_RED_TOXIC_DESC:0 "High-intensity scanners that make use of x-rays to penetrate §H[From.GetName]§!'s atmosphere, are being prepared to scan the surface.\n\nOur scientists hope that they can reveal the origin of the red fog. They speculate that it was perhaps not created by natural causes."

  EXPLORE_RED_TOXIC_DESC:0 "Due to the fogs extreme toxic and corrosive properties, exploring §H[From.GetName]§!'s surface makes it very dangerous for organic lifeforms, even with protective armor and hazard protection.\n\nAdvanced robotic exploration units are being used there instead, equipped with corrosion-resistant armor and energy shields."

  FIND_SCOURGE_ORIGIN_DESC:0 "Our robotic exploration units are being replaced and prepared,for an exploration to the 'ORIGIN Site' of the Scarlet Scourge.\n\nThe location is probably not only the origin point of the Scarlet Scourge, but maybe even the place it was originally created at."

  EXPLORE_REPOSITORY_DESC:0 "The Repository is the location of our final exploration on §H[From.GetName]§!, in order to locate the place where the Scarlet Scourge was originally created. Armed robotic exploration units are being deployed for this mission.\n\nIf the Repository is truly the birthplace of the Innovation Forge's greatest creations, it may be a dangerous place."

  INVESTIGATE_ONE_ORBIT_DESC:0 "Only a short time after we arrived in the §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§! system, our sensors began to detect strange planetary arrangements.\n\nIt appears that the star system possesses two planets that both share the same orbit. Their distance from their star is almost exactly the same.\n\nOur scientists want to investigate these two planets further, in order to find out more about them and this strange arrangement."

  INVESTIGATE_ONE_ORBIT_2_DESC:0 "The investigation of §H[From.From.GetName]§! will ultimately show us how this strange planetary arrangement is structured."

  INVESTIGATE_SCARRED_PLANET_DESC:0 "The Scar will be studied in regards to its geological structure and material composition, to find out what has created it.\n\nScanners are also analyzing the surrounding areas and the Scar itself, to detect unusual substances. Our scientists suspect that the Scar may have been created as the result of a weapon deployment."

  INVESTIGATE_WOUNDED_STAR_DESC:0 "Our science ship is on its way to investigate §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§!.\n\nIts secrets may finally give us access to the solution against $ehof_the_compound$. If not we will at least find the source of the message."

  INVESTIGATE_STELLAR_WOUND_DESC:0 "Our scientists are preparing multiple ships equipped with high intensity scanners to scan the entire star for the impactor.\n\nDue to the everchanging nature of the surfaces and interiors of stars, the impactor may, depending on the size, be located outside of the original path, with which it impacted on the star.\n\nA full scan of §H[Root.Solar_system.GetName]§! will thus be necessary."

  INVESTIGATE_DORMANT_LEVIATHAN_DESC:0 "Vast amounts of resources and the most advanced technologies of our empire and our allies, will be necessary to perform the investigation project of the gigantic spaceship located inside §H[Root.Solar_system.GetName]§!.\n\nResearchers and engineers from all over the empire, travel to the system in order to construct the necessary equipment and constructs for the project."

  ENTERING_LEVIATHAN_DESC:0 "Our scientists are now trying to find a way to enter the dormant leviathan spaceship.\n\nWho knows what technological wonders await us inside of this enigmatic colossus.\n\nHopefully, we can confirm it as the source of the message. It may even contain the solutions against $ehof_the_compound$ itself!"

  REPAIR_ANNIHILATOR_DESC:0 "We have agreed to help the $ehof_the_stellar_annihilator$ repair its power core in order to bring it out of that star and back into action.\n\nThis will be no small feat and will require our nation as a whole to come together and amass all the materials this mammoth operation will require."

  INVESTIGATE_ENIGMATIC_PATTERN_DESC:0 "It is only the crew of the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§! that remember the 12 hour period and the $ehof_eps$, but were fortunately able to record the $ehof_eps$ with portable devices.\n\nThe reports from the vessel need to be investigated further, to try and make sense of it.\n\nEven though no one has any idea where the energy flash that hit the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§! originated from, it happened in one of the already strange $ehof_cohesive$ systems.\n\nIn the meantime our science vessels have been advised to keep an eye open for more energy flashes and $ehof_eps$, while studying the $ehof_cohesive$ systems."

  EXPLORE_CREATOR_PLANET_DESC:0 "Now that $ehof_the_sphere$ has granted us access to its interior, we can finally unveil its secrets. Who knows what enigmatic and technological marvels and mysteries we'll discover inside it!"

  # Success description
  ehof_anomaly.10001.desc:0 "The exploration to the center of §H[From.From.GetName]§! was successful. Our exploration team has discovered that the core anomaly within §H[From.From.GetName]§!, is in fact a gigantic abandoned research facility, created by an unknown advanced civilization.\n\nThe core facility seems to be fully functional but was slightly damaged by an unknown incident.\n\nBased on the results of the exploration, the facility was constructed in order to study the exotic conditions within §H[From.From.GetName]§!'s center and used them for experiments and research.\n\nWhat happened to those who constructed the core facility is unknown.\n\nInvestigation of damage caused by the incident, shows that the facility is not at any risk and secure for re-establishment of the research activities.\n\nOur scientists request that we use the facility for our own interests and say that it would be really useful for our research."

  ehof_anomaly.10002.desc:0 "The exploration team which explored the large space station in the orbit of §H[From.From.GetName]§!, was able to determine its initial purpose.\n\nBased on the data the team was able to gather, the large space station was the central governmental seat of §H[From.From.GetName]§!'s former civilization. It was used in a similar way to how transnational/planetary collective governments are structured.\n\nThe civilization of §H[From.From.GetName]§! was on the verge of a global conflict, because of the rising tension between the member countries of the transnational government.\n\nThe tensions arose because of the lack of an important resource on §H[From.From.GetName]§!, which was called 'Gonva'.\n\nOur scientists were not able to identify the said resource solely based on the undamaged records on the station, but it was essential for the integrity of their society.\n\nThe struggle between the nations ultimately led to a thermonuclear war, which of course, devastated §H[From.From.GetName]§!"

  ehof_anomaly.10003.desc:0 "The long-lasting study of the interconnected plant genus on §H[From.From.GetName]§!, led to an incredible revelation.\n\nThe plants are, in fact behaving like a gigantic brain, stretching around the entire globe. Singular plants or rather plant colonies function like singular neurons or synapses.\n\nThe 'Planet-Plant-Brain' appears to posses some primitive form of consciousness, like that of animals, but still really different.\n\nAttempts to communicate with the brain led to failures, which are either based on the fact that the brain is not advanced enough for logical operations. like thoughts, or is not able to communicate at all.\n\nRegardless of the brains consciousness, its functionality gave us insight into advanced networking mechanics, which we can use to research technologies that are beneficial for our own networks."

  ehof_anomaly.10004.desc:0 "Our investigation of the connected asteroid station, led to bizarre discoveries that have yet to be understood.\n\nBased on our discoveries, the station was originally a fully self-sufficient colony, capable of housing and supporting hundreds of thousands of inhabitants.\n\nRecords found within the computer systems revealed, that it was a refuge for a civilization whose planet has been destroyed by an immense tectonic catastrophe, which they called 'The great crackening'. Said planet appears to be the cracked one in this system.\n\nThe confusing part about the station is the fact, that it is completely abandoned. Not a single form of biological life has been found, not even microbes within the artificial atmosphere. It appears that the colony has been entirely stripped of life, by an unknown event.\n\nAll records of a time period lasting about 17 minutes, have been corrupted 32 years and 121 days ago for unknown reasons. It is possible that the incident that led to the vanishing of all life on the station, happened within those 17 minutes.\n\nOur scientists are discussing whether it would be preferable to occupy the significant technology of the station and leave, due to the mysterious vanishing of the former inhabitants, or if it could be used as a valuable colony for our people."

  ehof_anomaly.10005.desc:0 "The intense study of samples of plasmatic lifeforms and observation of their ecosystem, led to astonishing results. Analysis of their pseudo-genetic basis led to the revelation that these lifeforms are truly inorganic biological lifeforms. Unlike machines, which are inorganic but not biological.\n\nThe conditions for the development of inorganic life are incredibly complex and rare, which is why there has almost none been discovered before.\n\nThe unique biological composition of their cells, makes use of intense high-temperature oxidation mechanisms and a simple but still formidable metallic liquid, which serves as their 'blood', to generate metabolic processes.\n\nThis gives them the ability to survive and flourish within this extreme environment.\n\nSingular celled but also multicellular organisms have been discovered, all capable of asexual reproduction. No forms of sexual reproduction has been detected yet, but our scientists want to launch a second investigation to find more complex organisms and maybe even advanced organisms, capable of social interactions or alike."

  ehof_anomaly.10006.desc:0 "Our exploration of §H[From.From.GetName]§!'s plasmatic ecosystem had an amazing breakthrough.\n\nClose to the south pole of §H[From.From.GetName]§!, our researchers found social plasmatic beings. These creatures appear to be able to build simple structures and use their bodies as tools, while being capable of communicating with each other and forming tiny packs. These packs increase the survivability of individual beings.\n\nBased on analysed observational data, they are at the pre-hunter like stage, socially individualized creatures usually go through. They are still far away from advanced social creatures, but it's an incredible discovery nonetheless.\n\nContinuing observation will be really useful for evolutionary biology and exobiological research."

  ehof_anomaly.10007.desc:0 "Our attempt to scan the surface of §H[From.From.GetName]§! with the help of x- rays was a success.\n\nOur systems created a model of an 82844 square kilometer area of the surface, that has been scanned with our high-intensity scanners.\n\nThe model reveals the presence of tree-like entities, distributed over large areas in high density and seemingly artificial entities that appear to be buildings.\n\nForests and cities are located on the planets surface, or at least the remnants of them.\n\nA civilization once existed on this toxic planet, and at least plant life was once part of the former planetary ecosystem.\n\nThe architecture and size of the buildings indicate, that the civilization was probably advanced enough for the development and use of technology. If the civilization itself is responsible for the red fog is unknown.\n\nUnfortunately, an exploration to the surface will be necessary, to find out more about what happened to the planet. Only records of the extinct civilization and maybe samples of the surface and environment, may tell us more about the red fog and its origin."

  ehof_anomaly.10008.desc:0 "The exploration of §H[From.From.GetName]§!'s surface was successful and revealed the nature of the red fog.\n\nThe red fog, called 'The Scarlet Scourge' by the inhabitants of §H[From.From.GetName]§!, is in fact of unnatural origin.\n\nIt is an advanced synthetic toxin, that was created by the former civilization of §H[From.From.GetName]§! and got out of control. By who and why the toxin was created, was unknown to the general population of the planet.\n\nEven records of governmental and scientific institutions, didn't reveal the origin of the Scarlet Scourge. This doesn't mean that the government never knew about it.\n\nAll that is known is that the toxin suddenly appeared at a specific location, somewhere in the northern hemisphere called 'ORIGIN Site', 321 galactic standard years ago.\n\nIt spread rapidly via the winds, due to its airborne nature and covered the planet within a year.\n\nFurthermore, the toxin is composed of particles of varying sizes, from the size of dust particles to the size of large virions, which makes it extremely difficult to contain, while still being able to cover the sky and surfaces.\n\nThe toxin is able to replicate itself by means yet unknown, which explains why it was able to cover the whole planet.\n\nIn the end, the entire civilization and the planetary ecosystem was destroyed by the unstoppable Scarlet Scourge.\n\nOur scientists want to expand the exploration efforts on §H[From.From.GetName]§!, despite the dangers, to find the origin of the Scourge."

  ehof_anomaly.10009.desc:0 "The investigation of the 'ORIGIN Site' revealed even more secrets about the Scarlet Scourge than previously anticipated.\n\nThe ORIGIN Site, originally called 'Hazard Testing Ground Y-173', was not the place of creation of the Scarlet Scourge, but a testing site utilized by the institution that originally created the Scarlet Scourge.\n\nSaid institution was a privately owned research and development organization called 'Innovation Forge', that supposedly housed the greatest minds of the civilization.\n\nThe Scarlet Scourge, named 'Compound 23RCA' by its creators, was used at the ORIGIN Site to study its effects on organic and inorganic matter, within a realistic environment.\n\nThe ORIGIN Site consists of an observation post and a large dome around a small towns and small forests, originally inhabited by voluntary test subjects, who were told that it was a climate control experiment. Animal life was also present.\n\nThe dome, composed of advanced isolation materials, was supposed to prevent the Scourge from leaking into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, even its creators underestimated its effects.\n\nThe Scourge corroded the domes material and leaked into the atmosphere, thus leading to the destruction of §H[From.From.GetName]§!'s civilization.\n\nThe records also revealed the coordinates of a location called 'The Repository', which apparently was the original main facility of the Innovation Forge and the place where,not only the Scourge was originally created, but their greatest creations in general.\n\nOur scientists want to travel to this location, in order to find out how the Scarlet Scourge was synthesized and unveil the secrets of this place."

  ehof_anomaly.10010.desc:0 "Our exploration of the Repository was a full success.\n\nThe Repository is a gigantic underground facility, hidden within a big mountain chain.\n\nIt was like the data of the ORIGIN Site stated, a tressure chest of technological innovation, with technology vastly superior to that of other planet-bound civilizations.\n\nThe Repository was protected by inherent security systems, as we expected. These turned out to be a challenge, even for our units.\n\nWe were able to locate the facility in which the Scarlet Scourge was originally created. There we able to find out everything that can be known about it.\n\nIt was the first fully functioning prototype of a series of terraforming agents, created by the Innovation Forge. These agents would be deployed on hostile, but potentially habitable planets, via space vessels in order to cleanse their atmosphere from hazardous substances, including biological ones. This explains the use of the ORIGIN Site, as a way to test the effects of the agent on lifeforms of all kinds, including intelligent ones.\n\nThe agent turned out to behave differently than expected, and in the end, became the very thing it was supposed to destroy.\n\nWithin the heart of the facility, we located an advanced intelligence that turned out to be an ensemble made out of the minds of the Innovation Forge's greatest scientists, who neurally uploaded their consciousness to expand their lifespan. They told us more about the Repository, the civilization of §H[From.From.GetName]§!, the Scarlet Scourge and about their solution for the Scarlet Scourge crisis.\n\nA gigantic tower named 'The Catalyst' was constructed by the Innovation Forge, close to the south pole. It was meant to cleanse the atmosphere from the Scarlet Scourge. The attempt to do so failed, because they were not able to find a way to stop the Scarlet Scourge from replicating.\n\nThe ensemble told us, that our superior technology may enable us to make the tower fully functional and cleanse the atmosphere from the Scarlet Scourge.\n\nWe can now either purify this world and make it habitable once again, or use the Scarlet Scourge for our own means."

  ehof_anomaly.10011.desc:0 "By investigating the first of the two planets in the §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§! system, §H[From.From.GetName]§!, we have found out that it is a rare, extremely habitable gaia world.\n\nIt possesses a higher than average mass and a typical rock planet density. The planetary ecosystem is of incredible variety and countless species exist there.\n\nStudying this planet may be really valuable for our biological research, but our focus lies on the study of §H[From.From.GetName]§!'s sibling planet."

  ehof_anomaly.10012.desc:0 "Our investigation of the second planet in the §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§! system, §H[From.From.GetName]§!, revealed something incredible.\n\n§H[From.From.GetName]§! has not only the same properties as its sibling planet, but is a gaia world too!\n\nThe two planets are both gaia worlds, which share the same mass, density, obliquity, orbit, rotational speed and orbital speed. The only thing that differentiates them from each other, is their ecosystem and the fact that they are not at the same location.\n\nThe entire system appears too unreal, but yet it is here. It has to be of artificial origin. The probability for such a planetary constellation to develop naturally, is essentially zero.\n\nSigns of the creators of this system have yet to be found..."

  ehof_anomaly.10013.desc:0 "Our intensified investigation efforts of the Scar, proved one of the hypothesis's for the Scars formation as true. The Scar was in fact, created through the deployment of a massive weapon.\n\nWe've seen weapons on a scale like this before, but the kind of weapon which has most likely caused the formation of the Scar, is what makes this case so fascinating. The geological structure, the angle in relation to the planet's surface, which is orientated from the surface of the planet, 60 kilometers down to the upper mantle, and discovered unusual substances in the area, lead to the suspicion, that the Scar was created as the result of the deployment of an enormous kinetic weapon. Furthermore, our sensors were able to determine an irregular path of radiation throughout the entire canyon.\n\nHowever, the radioactive contamination is not the result of substances that are radioactive by themselves, like plutonium, but the result of exposure to intense gamma radiation. This leads to the revelation that the kinetic projectile that hit the planet's surface and created the Scar, was also composed, at least partially, out of antimatter.\n\nThe reason why someone would shoot the planet with such a destructive weapon is unknown. It could have been for any reason. Weapon tests, war or a demonstration of power.\n\nFurthermore, our scientist were able to determine the age of the Scar, to about 1.25 million years. With the Scar being so old, any attempts of finding out more about this weapon would be futile."

  ehof_anomaly.10021.desc:0 "Our investigation of §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§! revealed that the star possesses a gigantic stellar anomaly on its surface. A gigantic indentation, with a diameter of about 3.3 million kilometers.\n\nIt may be dwarfed in size by the red giant itself, which has a diameter of about 105 million kilometers, but it is still incredibly massive nonetheless.\n\nThe indentation is theorized to be an 'impact crater', the remains of an astronomically energetic impact on the star.\n\nWhat the impactor was is unknown, but it must have either been a really massive impactor, or a really fast one.\n\nWe can't calculate exactly when the impact happened, due to the rapidly changing surface of the star. The everchanging surface of a star, makes even such enormous changes to the surface unrecognizable within a few hundred years.\n\nThe impact itself launched gigantic amounts of stellar plasma throughout the system, melting, breaking and heating up every planet in the system.\n\nThe impactor may still be recognizable and has perhaps something to do with the message.\n\nAn investigation of the outer and inner layers of the star will be necessary, in order to find traces of the impactor or even the impactor itself."

  ehof_anomaly.10022.desc:0 "We finally finished our investigation of the outer layers of §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§! and the the results are absolutely astonishing.\n\nIt wasn't a big planet that collided with the star, but a vessel, or at least we assume that it is a vessel.\n\nThe impactor is a gigantic artificial construct, that collided with the star millennia ago. It is still intact, as far as we can tell and it may perhaps be the source of the message itself!\n\nThe size of the construct is unimaginable for a ship, almost 2300 kilometers at its biggest extent. It possesses a mass of about 980,2 quadrillion metric tonnes, the mass of a small dwarf planet.\n\nFor a ship of this size, the speed that is necessary to release such incredible amounts of energy is still immense. Relativistic velocities are necessary to do so much damage to a star and all the surrounding planets, with such a low mass (compared to giant planets).\n\nOur scientists extrapolated a model of the impact, with the help of complex simulations and determined, that it had to have, regardless of its collision angle, a velocity of at least 5000 kilometers per second. The actual velocity was probably higher. We will not be able to determine the exact velocity, but our scientists are requesting that we try to study the vessel itself.\n\nThe effort to do so will definitely be enormous, because the ship is located within the stars convective zone, about 8 million kilometers under the stars photosphere (surface).\n\nDue to the fact, that the ship is still intact after surviving temperatures of more than 200.000° Celsius for millennia, the impact itself, is perhaps functional, and is very likely the source of the message, will absolutely be worth the enormous effort!"

  ehof_anomaly.10023.desc:0 "We made it! We've finally managed to reach the dormant gigantic space ship within §H[Root.Solar_System.GetName]§!. Doing so was an unbelievable undertaking.\n\nThe researchers and engineers of our empire and our allies were, with an almost limitless supply of resources and only time as their enemy, able to construct what they call a 'stellar anti-elevator-cable'.\n\nIt is a gigantic construct, a tunnel/cable with a width up to 50 kilometer and a length of 8 million kilometers in total, which stretches from the photosphere of the star, throughout its convective zone, to the location of the leviathan.\n\nThe anti-elevator is made out of the most advanced, self-conserving materials known to the galaxy, in order to withstand and adapt to the incredible conditions within the stars convective zone.\n\nOn the lower end of the anti-elevator, where the leviathan is located, a multitude of stations around the ship were built inside the stellar plasma, which are equipped with gravity manipulators. These stations are keeping the colossal ship in position, to prevent it from getting dragged away by the stellar plasmaflow.\n\nA relatively small dome, which is connected to the anti-elevator, was constructed on the side of the leviathan. This dome is a sheltered zone, constructed for working on the leviathan itself, without having to fear being vaporized by the immense heat.\n\nFurthermore, we were now able to effectively determine the state of the vessel, which in fact appears to be mostly intact. It is still unknown how the ships was able to survive inside of this star for many millennia, without any significant damage, but the technology of the ship appears to be far more advanced, than even the most advanced fallen empire technology.\n\nNone of our scanners were able to penetrate the unknown hull materials. Even though the hull appears to be solid, on closer examination, the material is more similar to supersolids, materials that possess both, solid and fluid properties. An everchanging quasi-supersolid, may explain the ships ability to survive inside the star.\n\nOur scientists are trying to find a way to get inside the ship, but are waiting for approval to do so."

  ehof_anomaly.10024.desc:0 "We didn't expect something like this to happen! As soon as we tried to use our tools, to open a path throughout the outer hull of the ship, the hull began to change and created a large corridor which allowed us to enter the ship. The corridor was large enough for us to use multiple vehicles at once to enter it.\n\nInside, the walls were coloured in pure white and were constantly reshaping in liquid-like behavior. Melting and solidifying for an unknown purpose. The structure of the liquid walls was homogeneous and uniform, without any form of difference in their structure, except for differences created by their everchanging nature.\n\nThe corridor was also as empty as possible. We were not able to find anything of technological or scientific value inside, besides the corridor itself.\n\nEven though the corridor was changing, the extent of it always stayed the same until we reached our final location.\n\nAfter a few minutes, we reached a gigantic empty hall, made out of the same everchangíng liquid as the corridor. At the beginning, nothing was inside of the hall, but that changed quickly.\n\nA sheer limitless number of unidentified entities, manifested themselves out of the liquid walls and began to swarm into the hall.\n\nThe entities thankfully didn't come to attack us. They assembled into a gigantic octahedron-formed entity, appearing to be made out of the same everchanging liquid as the walls.\n\nIt began to speak with us, mentally, as it is somehow able to directly tap into our minds, perhaps via psionic telepathy. It introduced itself as the dominant awareness of this vessel and told us that it is delighted that we made it.\n\nIt demands immediate contact to our leaders, as the fate of the universe is at stake."

  ehof_anomaly.16.desc:0 "This is terrible! We suddenly received reports from §H[From.From.GetName]§! about sudden, strange and intense mental breakdowns of our colonists. The rate at which inhabitants began to have breakdowns increased and it abruptly got quiet.\n\nWe sent an investigation team to our colonists, just to discover that they've all vanished. Just like the original inhabitants of §H[From.From.GetName]§!, our colonists vanished through unknown causes.\n\nThe records are also all corrupted again.\n\nWhat the reasons for these abnormal events on §H[From.From.getName]§! are, remains a mystery."

  ehof_anomaly.10417.desc:0 "It's unimaginable!\n\nAfter many years of investigating $ehof_the_sphere$, countless of its secrets have been uncovered. $ehof_the_sphere$ itself, is a technological marvel of astronomical magnitudes.\n\nSomething, which can only be described as a miniature universe, a enormous bubble of folded spacetime, is located inside it! $ehof_the_sphere$ serves as a protective, everchanging and indestructible shell, to prevent influence from the outside universe.\n\nThe spacetime volume of this microverse is inversely folded, relative to the outside space, making the volume inside $ehof_the_sphere$ bigger than $ehof_the_sphere$ itself. In fact, the volume of the spacetime bubble is several thousand times bigger than $ehof_the_sphere$!, making it bigger than most solar systems!\n\n$ehof_the_sphere$ thermally separates the microverse from the rest of the universe, making it a closed system. The microverse is divided into two separate regions, which our researchers call the outer and the inner volume. The two volumes are separated by possessing distinct vacuum energy densities. Vacuum energy is the intrinsic energy of the underlying vacuum background of space, and its density is essential for the way matter and energy behave.\n\nThe outside volume possesses a vacuum energy density virtually identical to that of the outside universe and is filled with entire stars! Countless technological entities are located inside the outer volume, which seem to harness the energy of the stars, the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum energy and even extra-dimensional energies of unknown origin.\n\nThe inner volume appears to be an empty void, filled purely with antiparticle-particle pairs from quantum fluctuations. However, it possesses a much larger vacuum energy density than the outer volume. Determining the initial purpose of this enormous construct is an almost impossible task. What we were able to find out gives rise to the assumption, that the reason for the segregation of the volume into the two distinct ones, is to generate ridiculously large amounts of energy! All the energy gets extracted inside the outer volume and then siphoned into the inner volume, where it remains until utilized. The energy content of the inner volume was determined to be at least 10^49 Joule, which is equivalent to the total mass-energy of a supermassive star. Furthermore, we were able to determine the purpose of the amplifiers and the archaic stones/pylons. The amplifiers and archaic pylons work in unison as energy and information distributors, which are scattered all throughout the galaxy, numbering in the dozens of millions. They are used to create a gigantic energy and information distribution network, and are supposed to utilize the energy provided by $ehof_the_sphere$ to create quasi-negative mass, which also explains why the $ehof_cohesive$ systems possess quasi-negative mass. The amplifiers are both, repeaters of the enigmatic pattern, the sentient administration protocol of the galactic distribution network, and generators for quasi-negative mass. The archaic stones/pylons are used to distribute the orders of the $ehof_the_sphere$ around the network and transmit information between amplifiers and $ehof_the_sphere$. This means that there are many more $ehof_cohesive$ systems in the galaxy, than we preciously anticipated! Unfortunately, we were still not able to determine what the initial purpose for this gigantic construct and network is. The most astonishing revelation is that $ehof_the_sphere$ is not the only construct of its type, and there are at least a few more located somewhere outside of our galaxy. Whatever it is the creators of these enormous constructs wanted to achieve, it needed more energy than thousands of stars could generate in their entire lifetime! Where and who the creators are is unknown. Nonetheless, we were able to learn unimaginably much from $ehof_the_sphere$. The knowledge yielded from our studies will advance our civilization by a astronomical margin!"
