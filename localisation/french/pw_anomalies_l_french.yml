    pw_anomaly_ruined_particle_supercollider_category: "Collider in Ruins"
    pw_anomaly_ruined_particle_supercollider_category_desc: "A huge structure in a circular shape lies in ruins in the surface of this planet, it still has sings of energy flowing, but its purpose is a mystery."
    pw_anomaly.20.name: "Ancient Collider"
    pw_anomaly.20.desc: "After analyses of the circular structure in [FROM.GetName], it becomes clear that it served as a laboratory and test site for particle collision and filed manipulation experiments. Already it seems like a building unimaginable for us to construct, because of the sheer scale of the place, and the immense quantity of resources it must have taken.\nThe Collider has been abandoned for many centuries, as sensors suggest, and little of the equipment is still functioning, with the notable exception of several computer terminals and some energy banks that are still charging. In the terminals we could find some accessible data drives that should provide us with knowledge from the old experiments executed here and add to our own research. Alternative, we could harvest the remaining energy from the facility."
    pw_anomaly.20.a: "Take what we can learn from their researches."
    pw_anomaly.20.b: "We need that energy, start loading the batteries."
    pw_anomaly_ruined_domed_city_category: "Broken Dome"
    pw_anomaly_ruined_domed_city_category_desc: "A huge segment of ancient ruins in this planet appears to have an overarching structure covering it. There does not seem to be much left for archeology, but it is bound to have something interesting."
    pw_anomaly.30.name: "Ruined Dome"
    pw_anomaly.30.desc: "By scanning the ruined structures of [FROM.GetName] we could determine that they are comprised of a city completely enclosed by a dome, which has long been breached and ruined. Not much is left outside of the dome, or indeed inside the city, but there are some evidence to suggest that the structure was an observation post for the inhabitants of the Domed City. Who knows what kind of social experiments may have been conducted here?\nEvery finding we can extract from the city seem to be of a completely different time and culture from ours and there is much to be learned from studying the ruins. Alternatively, we can scavenge the city, ignoring all the cultural memory in favor of the cultural relics that still remain, and could be worth a great deal."
    pw_anomaly.30.a: "We can discover how they lived."
    pw_anomaly.30.b: "Scavenge it for valuables."
    pw_anomaly.30.c: "Plunder all, nothing is sacred."
    pw_anomaly_ruined_abyssal_test_crater_category: "Abyssal Crater"
    pw_anomaly_ruined_abyssal_test_crater_category_desc: "A deep crater in the surface of [Root.GetName] shows peculiar readings and indicatives of ruins in proximity."
    pw_anomaly.40.name: "Ancient Bombardment Station"
    pw_anomaly.40.desc: "Preliminary analyses of the contour of the crater in [FROM.GetName] show that the ruins in its proximity used te be some form of laboratory, with a variety of instruments to measure projectiles parameters, such as speed, force an impact damage. The data banks seem to still contain information that could be useful to our own research in the matter.\nFurther analysis of the crater suggests that it was used as the test site for impact bombardment from orbit, Several types and models of missiles carcasses and bombs shell can be found at the bottom of the crater, which shows that it is much deeper than when it naturally formed. Sensors show that the bottom of this pit is littered with the expended ordnance and forms treasure trove of alloys, used in their construction."
    pw_anomaly.40.a: "Focus on their old research, extract what we can."
    pw_anomaly.40.b: "We need the real things, salvage the metals from the crater."
    pw_anomaly_ruined_galactic_model_category: "Lumps of Earth"
    pw_anomaly_ruined_galactic_model_category_desc: "There are strange land formations in the shape of many spheres of meters in diameter on the surface of this planet, definitely unnatural and deserving of a closer look."
    pw_anomaly.80.name: "Galaxy in Ruins"
    pw_anomaly.80.desc: "Analyses of the earth spheres found in [FROM.GetName] reveal only ordinary mineral, like silica and quartz, in their composition, that seem to be native to the planet. The interesting aspect of this locality show themselves in the configuration and position of the spheres. After many attempts at decoding their significance, science officer [Root.Leader.GetName] encountered a breakthrough when [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] overlapped a stellar map of explored sectors of the galaxy onto an aerial view of the spheres.\nIt turns out they are arranged to form a map of the galaxy, in which each sphere represents a planet, a moon or an asteroid; other celestial bodies seem to be lost to time. Although badly damaged from erosion, we could find our home system in this Galactic Model, but not much else. We can scan the whole area to help science ships with further surveil of the universe and improve the sensitivity of our ships to hyperlanes."
    pw_anomaly.80.a: "A curious assembly, and useful."
    pw_anomaly_ruined_enigma_engine_debris_category: "Pings in the Dark"
    pw_anomaly_ruined_enigma_engine_debris_category_desc: "Something in this asteroid field emits a repeating and cyphered signal and continuous movement has been detected."
    pw_anomaly.100.name: "A Machine"
    pw_anomaly.100.desc: "Searching through the asteroid field, [Root.Leader.GetName] has found many pieces of machinery floating adrift between the rocks. Following this mechanical trail, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] encountered a huge assortment of gears, rotors, antennas and pulleys amalgamated into a singular machine, bridging two asteroids drifting away in space. Curiously, the letters S.H.C. seem to be stamped in many of the composing parts. This appears to be the source of the signal and the movement as its wheels keep turning, even with no apparent power source.\nIt is clearly an autonomous system of some sort, but many mysteries regarding its origin remain. A special project can be prepared to investigate further details."
    pw_anomaly.100.a: "its purpose must be determined."
    pw_anomaly.100.b: "It is heresy. Let the asteroids consume it."
    pw_anomaly.101.name: "Engine of Enigma"
    pw_anomaly.101.desc: "The more we analyse the signal from the strange machine in the asteroid field the more we are away from a deciphered version, and the more it is clear to us that the meaning of this signal is so important. It denominated an Enigma Engine by our scientists. While working on the signal, we could investigate the machine for clues.\nThe best we could determine is that this device is dedicated to technology in its purest form, aggregating new mechanism that enter in contact with it. Then it produces some form of signal, perceived by our sensors, that produce an ever changing frequency. Some of these signals seem to interact with recorded experiments, boosting our research.\nThe elusive acronym S.H.C. remains a mystery, but it is speculated that it refers to the original constructor - or constructors - of this Engine."
    pw_anomaly.101.a: "We can't understand the signal, but use it for research."
    pw_anomaly.101.b: "We ask and the signal answers. Attempt to replicate it."
    pw_anomaly.102.name: "Echoes and Shades"
    pw_anomaly.102.desc: "We have chased this signal into the asteroids and many drones attempted to decipher the perpetual movements of the Enigma Engine, to no avail. We have come to realization that this signal was not made for us. It has helped us realize that we must find and build our own signal, after understanding much of the universe that is still left to understand. By pursuing this signal we will be able to build our own Enigma Engine, with its own enigma to be deciphered by us and its own pseudo-answers for us to forever chase."
    pw_anomaly.102.a: "Set it as our goal. It is our Purpose."
    pw_anomaly_ruined_solipsist_debate_hall_category: "Echoing Ruins"
    pw_anomaly_ruined_solipsist_debate_hall_category_desc: "Readings of this planet show what seems a central building emanating erratic low frequency signals, that deserve an investigation."
    pw_anomaly.110.name: "Parliament of Unity"
    pw_anomaly.110.desc: "Expedition of the strange ruins in [FROM.GetName] show a singular ruined great complex of discussion chambers and parliamentary halls. Most of the walls here were lost to time, but the ones that remain seem to be constructed to propagate subspace signals, like brain waves. That, and the distinguish plant of the facility that could be reconstructed, showing no podium and equal positioning of all members, seem to suggest that some extreme egalitarianism or indeed gestalt unity were at the core of this society.\nScientist have also found a device called Syncretic Known and Hypothetical Analysis Network, left here a long time ago by previous explores, given its preserved state and distinct manufacturing and purpose. This device appears to have captured ancient subspace signals that reverberated in these chambers, and could contain the key to understand the purpose of this place and the ancient secrets debated here."
    pw_anomaly.110.a: "Attempt to retrieve and decode the contents of the device."
    pw_anomaly.110.b: "None of that interests us. Destroy the device."
    pw_anomaly.111.name: "Dialogs of One"
    pw_anomaly.111.desc: "After many months of retrieving and transliterating the echoing mental signals trapped inside the Syncretic Known and Hypothetical Analysis Network, recovered from the ruined Debate Hall in [FROM.GetName], we have gathered many useful information about the construction of this elusive building. It seems the society that built such wonder was formed of a single mind in multiple organisms, connected by subspace wave. This Hive Mind had many curious thoughts about the universe and other life forms, and relegated those doubts to be discussed in here, simulating deviancy, but creating a sort of Solipsist Debate Hall. A lot of the debates were lost by the device, but we have collected enough to shed a different light into our own societal research. In the same sense that such a Gestalt Consciousness was interested in individualist life forms, so too we are in their debates."
    pw_anomaly.111.a: "Horrendous life. But the insights are welcome."
    pw_anomaly.111.b: "Such a wonderful new perspective to life."
    pw_anomaly.111.c: "Stimulating. Delve further into the secrets of the building."
    pw_anomaly.111.d: "Information incorporated. The rest is spurious."
    pw_anomaly.112.name: "Solipsist Debate Hall"
    pw_anomaly.112.desc: "Diligent inspection of each chamber of the Debate Hall shows that it was specifically created by and to some Hive Mind organism, of that no doubts are left. Although the original creator's form was much different form our own, much of the building could be rebuild with corrections, to adapt for our personal use. The ruins reveal that a lot was planned for this structure: egalitarian debate halls, confrontational battle chambers and expositional projectors. Of note, it was found a framework of some sort of super computer, with terminals scattered throughout the building; the function of such machine could not be determined, however, for most of its processors and data banks were missing.\nThere is still a lot of progress to be made first, before putting the Mind to the goal of replicating this wonder in our terms, for our benefit, but this serves as a fine starting point for ideas."
    pw_anomaly.112.a: "We are still to leave our mark in the Universe."

    pw_anomaly_frozen_war_titan_category: "Winter in Assault"
    pw_anomaly_frozen_war_titan_category_desc: "Readings of an energy source showed up in our radars coming from somewhere beneath the ice of [ROOT.GetName]. The signal is weak, but anomalous readings surrounding this source suggest an interesting investigation."
    pw_anomaly.130.name: "Ancestral Powers"
    pw_anomaly.130.desc: "The energy source in [FROM.GetName] has been found to belong to some ancient war machine, trapped in centuries of ice. The machine - identified as a War Titan - is of alien design and shows great mastery of the field of engineering. Much of the Titan is gone, but from what remains we could predict it would stand as high as most of our buildings and bear as much artillery as our planetary division, truly a machine of war. In its current state, we can attempt to salvage the War Titan from the ice, and possibly obtain an assault machine with a fraction of its original military power. Alternatively, we could attempt to extract what technology we can from the original design."
    pw_anomaly.130.a: "The Titan shall rise again, attempt to salvage it."
    pw_anomaly.130.b: "A schematic of this would be of more use."
    pw_anomaly.130.c: "No need for the Titan, but we could use that energy source."
    pw_anomaly.130.d: "Leave the machine to its frozen prison."
    pw_anomaly.131.name: "Final Journey"
    pw_anomaly.131.desc: "While attempting to retrieve the War Titan from its frozen prison, science officer [LEADER.GetName] planed to extract it from the closest point to the surface, the particle cannon in its left hand. However, the structural integrity of the titan was not as projected and the team was only able to retrieve the weapon before the rest of the titan sank further into the glacier. The salvage operation was called off as most of the Titan was deemed inoperable by this mistake"
    pw_anomaly.131.a: "Unfortunate. At least we can study this hand cannon."
    pw_anomaly.132.name: "[OWNER.GetAdj] Titan"
    pw_anomaly.132.desc: "Trough careful ice manipulation and skilled use of the War Titans own energy source, its extraction operation was a success!\nThe salvaged War Titan has been entirely removed from the encasing ice and already we have posted soldiers in its control panels. They have soon discovered the ancient and enigmatic systems that are required to operate this machine, but they will soon master it. Our scientists find it extremely difficult to reverse engineer the design, but it matters little as the presence of this ancient machine can turn the tide of any land battle as it is."
    pw_anomaly.132.a: "The Titan rises once again."

    pw_anomaly.81.name: "Minimal Map"
    pw_anomaly.81.desc: "It seems that the markings found on the surface of §Y[FROM.GetName]§! are meant to represent all of the planets that form the [FROM.Solar_System.GetName] System. Our science team speculates that the representation is not spiritual in nature, but an attempt to star a galactic map!\n\nWhile limited, depiction of planets in this system are precise and extremely detailed. It can be used to help our science team survey the remaining planets or uncover secrets they may have overlooked."
    pw_anomaly.81.a: "Plug the data into the scanners."
    pw_anomaly_TF_abandoned_forge: "Disturbed Mantle"
    pw_anomaly_TF_abandoned_forge_desc: "Readings show that [ROOT.GetName] has some internal disturbance within its planetary mantle. Evidences suggest that the cause could be of artificial nature."
    pw_anomaly.133.name: "Sabotaged Forge"
    pw_anomaly.133.desc: "Exploration of the epicenter of sensed disturbances in §Y[FROM.GetName]§! have led the science team to a massive underground military complex, derelict and abandoned a long ago. It seems that the complex was completely dedicated to the production of weapons and machines of war, drawing energy from the planetary mantle to fuel titanic alloy foundries, even to the detriment of the planets crust and structure. Further analysis shows that the facility was sabotaged, rather than abandoned, an event which may have sealed the destine of life at the surface of this planet forever.\n\nInteresting to think of a nation so focused on war, letting itself be the target of this sabotage manuever in such a crucial facility. In any case, the facility could still have valuable alloys or we could try and explore their production process."
    pw_anomaly.133.a: "Salvage anything usefully."

    pw_anomaly.134.name: "Abandoned Industry"
    pw_anomaly.134.desc: "Analyses of §Y[FROM.GetName]§! still elude us about the cause of its uninhabitability, however the scientists are sure that the subterranean complex present here contribute to that outcome. Upon exploration, the underground structure was revealed to be an immense factory for all kinds of consumer goods, that would draw energy from the planetary mantle to power the producing machines.\n\nThis kind of planetary exploitation may have been the key factor in the collapse of local biosphere, and evidence suggests that whomever build this factory had no concern for the environment. In fact, given the way goods were produced here, they seem to have been a very consumerist and wasteful society, driven to cut costs in every step of their industry."
    pw_anomaly.134.a: "They won't be needing those goods anymore."
    pw_anomaly.134.b: "Incorporate the designs of their machines on our protocols."

    pw_anomaly.140.name: "Hidden Caches of Art"
    pw_anomaly.140.desc: "Exploration of the mysterious asteroid revealed that the rock is actually hollow, which accounts for its disparity in mass. A hidden reinforced door in its surface leads to a hidden cache inside, containing a vast quantity of works of art - drawings, sculptures and even some digital media that we could no decipher. It is truly a treasure trove of culture.\n\nFurther analysis and translation of found documents inside the asteroid point towards an explanation for this cache of art: our science team believes it was the deposit of stolen pieces that belonged to an infamous art thief about a millennia ago. The presence of many different art styles, that certainly come form different cultures corroborates with this theory."
    pw_anomaly.140.a: "That belongs in a museum, exhibit them at the capital."
    pw_anomaly.140.b: "Set a study post here, to better preserve the pieces."

    pw_anomaly.141.name: "Poetry Contest"
    pw_anomaly.141.desc: "The science team has collected the mysterious container they have found on the asteroid. It seems to be a specialized shipping container for delicate data. It constrains a great number of printed and digital texts that appear to be some sort of alien poetry, that have proven to be hard to translate, given their purposefully abstract semantic. The amount and variety of texts suggest that they were destined to some organized poetry contest, hundreds of years ago.\n\nOur scientist believe that fully translating the texts may help our envoys with future first contacts and complex alien grammar."
    pw_anomaly.141.a: "Fully translate the texts."
    pw_anomaly.141.b: "Study alien culture trough the texts."

    pw_anomaly.142.name: "Translated Poetry"
    pw_anomaly.142.desc: "The recovered poetry cache has finally been fully translated. It seems it was indeed many entries for a declamation competition, for each texts tried to outdo the previous by using more complex grammatical constructions and almost unintelligible meanings.\n\nBut in the end, there was much to learn from theses texts and we shall be much more equipped to investigate different alien communication in the future."

    pw_anomaly.143.desc: "Investigation of the processes involved in the manipulation of light in the atmosphere of §Y[FROM.GetName]§! has led our science team to a gas dispersal device, revealing that the gases here are not natural and are deliberately used to change the color of the skies. Further analysis of the gas contents have revealed no biological or chemical harming agents, as far as we could determine, the gas is purely cosmetic.\n\nIt seems that the gas usage is some form of cultural ritual that happened here centuries ago, but there is only enough gas to fill the atmosphere one last time. We should focus our studies if we wish to uncover something."
    pw_anomaly.143.a: "Disperse the gas in our capital."

    pw_anomaly.144.name: "Exposition of Hate"
    pw_anomaly.144.desc: "Investigation of the mysterious passage of §Y[FROM.GetName]§! have revealed an abandoned underground deposit of cultural artifacts. This collection of art pieces appear to form an exposition, and from what we could gather, its propose is not to exalt the works being shown, but to shame and degrade them. It looks like whomever organized such and exhibition had a particular disdain for alien morals and kept a list of grievances they had with each piece, detailing the ways in which those works violated a specific set of traditions.\n\nIn one way this is a disturbing way of showing art, in another it is an unique exposition of a hateful ideology."
    pw_anomaly.144.a: "The first good xeno idea, exhibit them as is in our capital."

When investigating the vessel, the team found the cargo hold still intact and outfitted for transportation of valuable goods, almost the entire inventory of the ship was comprised of heavily decorated and completely different clothing pieces.The best hypothesis is that the cargo ship was trapped while on its way to some sort of artistic exhibition of exotic and alien clothing, many centuries ago.\n\nNow we have a full assemblage of cultural artifacts from a distant time. It may yield interesting research or a fabulous exhibition."

    pw_anomaly.170.desc: "Analysis of the tunnel system found on §Y[FROM.GetName]§! have revealed that it was used as a planetary logistics network, covered in transportation and sorting machines, capable of distributing goods to every corner of this world in record time. It seems that minerals retrieved from the tunnels excavation were used as raw material in the production of goods to distribute, but there are still many valuables to extract. No trace of the tunnels builders remain, but from our investigation they appear to have come from a civilization that valued equality highly, bent on guaranteeing that every material need of their population was met.\n\nIn one hand, study of this impressive excavation can yield interesting construction, distribution or production techniques; in another, if we were to stablish a mining operation, half of our work would be already done."

    pw_anomaly.180.desc: "Interior imaging of the protected structure at §Y[FROM.GetName]§! shows that it was most likely a palace of some kind, that served as central authority of a millenary alien empire. The construction materials suggest that this empire was at the brink of stellar travel before some catastrophic event wiped their entire civilization and only this palace has survived. Despite their technological level, the techniques employed in the construction of this structure - and the fact that it still stands - are remarkable.\n\nAlongside the walls and celling, the only object to resist the passage of time is an imperial throne, located right at the center of the complex, and still bearing the mummified remains of its final user!"
