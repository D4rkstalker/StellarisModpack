Welcome to our glorious utopia and home, $ehof_trader_new_system$.\n\nWe are the $ehof_trader$ and our intentions are peaceful. It may appear rude to you that we don't introduce ourselves further, or let you introduce yourselves first, but the situation is urgent.\n\nWe must ask you if you possess an extremely rare resource, which is essential for the survival of our civilization.\n\nDo you possess $ehof_alt_qnm$?"

	ehof_mega_trader.006.c:0 "$ehof_trader_new_system$ has so many wormholes..."
	ehof_mega_trader.006.c.response:0 "Wormholes are our primary form of interstellar travel. We're capable of generating both permanent and temporary connections, much like the ones you are able to create.\n\nWe have yet to discover any other means of interstellar travel and though you may be tempted to offer us other methods of interstellar travel, we would prefer to discover them in our own time, should the need arise.\n\nIn order to open a wormhole between $ehof_trader_new_system$ and the target system, we have to travel to the target system and build a wormhole constructor to create a psionic link between the two systems. Then we open a wormhole, by aligning the wormhole constructors through the psionic link and use a tremendous amount of psionic energy to rip open the wormhole simultaneously in both systems.\n\nThrough the use of $ehof_qnm$, we can stabilize the systems indefinitely. The wormholes will then be linked and traversable. This is why we need $ehof_qnm$, without it the wormholes would only be temporary and would collapse shortly after being opened. We only open wormholes from $ehof_trader_new_system$ to the others, because it is our central hub, our home, and the amount of $ehof_qnm$ we possess to open wormholes is limited. Or at least it was until we happened across you.\n\nIt is possible for us to create temporary wormholes in order to travel to other systems without a wormhole constructor, but doing so takes more energy, with no means of returning any extracted resources. This is not beneficial to $ehof_trader_new_system$ and our dream of building a utopia of never before seen magnitudes. It has been a goal we set to achieve a millennia ago, after the great war and the events inside our original home system, $ehof_trader_old_system$.\n\nHowever, with your technology, these systems would be beneficial to you and you would be free to do with them whatever you desire."

	ehof_mega_trader.006.e:0 "What is that $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$?"
	ehof_mega_trader.006.e.response:0 "The $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ has been here long before our existence. It is said our predecessors learned how to unlock $ehof_gateway_disableds$.\n\nIf you have any $ehof_gateway_disableds$, we would be prepared to give insight on how they work in exchange for some $ehof_qnm$."

	ehof_mega_trader.006.d:0 "What do you know about $ehof_qnm$?"
	ehof_mega_trader.006.d.response:0 "Though we discovered $ehof_qnm$ long ago, we have yet to unveil all of its secrets. What we do know is that it cannot be, or at least extremely unlikely to emerge naturally.\n\nIts properties appear to violate multiple fundamental laws of physics. For example, the stress component of the stress-energy tensor is larger than the mass density of the space in which it is located, which should be impossible.\n\n$ehof_qnm$ is not like the pseudo-negative mass like properties of the negative energy density of the vacuum, which fuel the cosmic expanse. It is a true form of negative mass, which could not have occurred within the passed lifetime of the universe.\n\nThe fact that you have $ehof_qnm$ in larger magnitudes than we were ever able to gather from $ehof_trader_dt$, without creating it yourself, means it was either created in an extremely unlikely event, or it was in fact created by advanced beings, capable of its creation. We believe the latter to be true."

	ehof_mega_trader.006.b:0 "We'd like to know more about you"
	ehof_mega_trader.007.desc:0 "What would you like to know?"
	ehof_mega_trader.007.a:0 "Who are you?"
	ehof_mega_trader.007.a.response:0 "We are the $ehof_trader$, an egalitarian society of techno-organic lifeforms, gifted with psionic abilities by $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nOur goal is to make $ehof_trader_new_system$, our central solar system, into an astonishing utopia of unseen magnitudes.\n\nWe live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$, who are guiding us and helping us to achieve this ultimate goal, while we grow together and evolve peacefully and mindfully."

	ehof_mega_trader.007.b:0 "What is your history?"
	ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response:0 "Our central hub, $ehof_trader_new_system$ is connected to $ehof_trader_old_system$, our original home system. You may have noticed, the whole system is devastated and filled with the remains of numerous ships and constructs. These are the remains of the fleets, habitats and structures of our organic forerunners.\n\nMillennia ago, when they were still planet-bound, $ehof_trader_dt$ was already in $ehof_trader_old_system$. It is unknown how long it has existed there, but it is at least as old as our history. When they first witnessed the existence of $ehof_trader_d$, they set their focus on reaching it. Even though it took them centuries until they were able to leave their home world, their focus never wavered. Reaching $ehof_trader_dt$ was their main goal. $ehof_trader_t$ appeared to be some kind of planet, in reality, it is a gate, a portal to an extra-dimensional realm, $ehof_trader_realm$.\n\nWhen they first physically entered $ehof_trader_realm$, they came into contact with the entity. It was kind and considerate, teaching them about the wonders of the inter-dimensional reality, that watches and dreams, $ehof_shroud$. They began to live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$ and were guided by it, to achieve a higher state of society and being. It is the reason we have psionic abilities, which manifested shortly after the first contact with $ehof_trader_d$. Their civilization developed into a glorious, stellar empire, $ehof_trader_dominion$. All worlds of $ehof_trader_old_system$ were colonized and the empire was centered around $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nUnfortunately, this astonishing expansion and development was not ever-lasting. The maximum capacity of $ehof_trader_old_system$ was reached, and without additional worlds, the resources would soon be depleted and the great stellar empire would perish. The only logical consequence was extra-stellar expansion. Faster than light travel technologies had not been developed yet and sending countless people with generation ships and resources to a neighboring system, in order to terraform it into a suitable one, was no option.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ decided to develop a form of machine intelligences, which would be able to traverse the gap between $ehof_trader_old_system$ and the most suitable system, $ehof_trader_new_system$, to terraform it for the empire. These were the forerunners of the machines, $ehof_trader_machines$."

	ehof_mega_trader.007.continue:0 "Continue"

	ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response.b:0 "Many years had passed since the terraforming machines had originally been sent to $ehof_trader_new_system$. They terraformed $ehof_trader_new_system$ into a suitable system for the people of $ehof_trader_dominion$. Surprisingly, the system was not the only thing that changed. The flow of time began to change the machines and they became self-aware, thinking machines that grew to love $ehof_trader_new_system$ and wanted it for their own, a development which was not tolerable for $ehof_trader_dominion$. Extrasolar expansion was the only option and now there was a terraformed, suitable system, not far away, ready to be colonized and now their very own creations, made especially for that purpose, choose to keep the system for themselves. This lead to tensions between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, which would lead to a vast conflict, we refer to as, the Great War.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ and the $ehof_trader_machines$ waged war and fought over the possession of $ehof_trader_new_system$. The biggest problem for both parties was that their strength were evenly matched, no side could really win the war. $ehof_trader_dominion$s psionic supremacy versus the technological-mechanical genius of $ehof_trader_machines$. If the war would have continued the way it was, it would have led to the extinction of both, $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$. An event $ehof_trader_d$ saw as likely. In order to prevent the extinction of all intelligent life in the systems, $ehof_trader_d$ proposed a solution which would not only end the war, but also solve the problems between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, The Amalgamation.\n\nThe Amalgamation, the unification of the organic people of $ehof_trader_dominion$ and the mechanical Excognitor, would bring birth to a new, ascended kind of beings, The $ehof_trader$, us, having the strength and wisdom of both kinds, without any of the flaws.\n\nAfter the Amalgamation was carried out and our people were born, we made it our goal to create a perfect utopia in $ehof_trader_new_system$, the system our forerunners fought for, and have since left $ehof_trader_old_system$ as a monument to the sins of those who came before us."

	ehof_mega_trader.007.c:0 "What is $ehof_trader_d$ and $ehof_trader_t$?"
	ehof_mega_trader.007.c.response:0 "$ehof_trader_d$ is an immaterial entity, which inhabits $ehof_trader_realm$. It has yet to be revealed, if $ehof_trader_d$ inhabits its realm and is a separate entity, or if it is the realm itself.\n\n$ehof_trader_realm$ is a part of the multiverse's, inter-dimensional fabric of $ehof_shroud$.\n\n$ehof_shroud$ has countless entities, of which $ehof_trader_d$ is a youngling of, which was born long ago, when $ehof_trader_dt$ originally emerged. This created both, the permanent connection to $ehof_shroud$ and $ehof_trader_realm$ itself, and in turn $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nWhen $ehof_trader_dt$ was created is unknown, but it was probably before our organic forerunners emerged on their home world. $ehof_qnm$ is what keeps $ehof_trader_dt$ open, but it is also what allows us to open the wormholes to other systems and keep them open.\n\nUnfortunately, we need to extract the $ehof_qnm$ from $ehof_trader_dt$, to use it for our wormholes. With $ehof_qnm$ being a limited resource, this would one day either mean, that we cannot construct any additional wormholes anymore and permanently halt our expansion, or it would lead to the collapse of $ehof_trader_dt$ and cut our connection to $ehof_trader_d$, which would lead to the loss of our psionic abilities and $ehof_trader_d$'s' guidance. Both of these events could or would lead to the collapse of our civilization, which is why we need your $ehof_qnm$ to keep expanding and stabilize $ehof_trader_dt$."
