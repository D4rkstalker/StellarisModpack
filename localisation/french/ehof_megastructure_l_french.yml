The fields serve as enormous immaterial tweezers for the inflation process and are also keeping the $ehof_wormholes$ open.\n\nIn order to increase the stability of the $ehof_wormholes$, the $ehof_ehofp2$ is equipped with Negative Pressure Application Plates, which apply negative pressure to the $eho_eh$, while a $ehof_wormhole$ is getting inflated. This cools down the local space around the black hole, by reducing the number of $ehof_qf$ and as a consequence the quantum tunneling effects.

This allows the creation of gravielectromagnetic quasi-fields, which create a repulsive force, that can be used to inflate the $ehof_wormholes$.

These processes may be extremely efficient at what they are supposed to do, but they are still not perfect.\n\nHowever, through our knowledge yielded from $ehof_the_sphere$, we were able to develope Vacuum Energy Density Resonance Stimulation.
