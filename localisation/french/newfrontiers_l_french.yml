  START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN:0 "Every [GetSpeciesName] knows the story of the old days, when our civilization still lived on the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] and did not know scarcity. But our blazing sun burned this world to the ground and a relative few survivors managed to hide underground. For many centuries they dug tunnels, cultivated caves, mined resources, and studied technology, until we learned how to ascend again, seeing what the once blooming home of our ancestors turned into.\n\nNow we must restore the former greatness of our civilization for the glory of our ancestors and the sake of our posterity."
  START_SCREEN_SCAVENGERS:0 "We don’t know how we got to [GetHomeWorldName]. There is still a debate about whether the [GetSpeciesNameAdj] race was once servants of the owners of this world, imported from some distant world. Or maybe we were just pets that have evolved as a result of mutations in this radioactive cesspool. However, our researchers have come to the conclusion that our ancestors we definitely not the crazy people who brought their home planet to such a monstrous state and then perished without a trace.\n\nWe learn fast and already about posess almost all of our predecessor's technology. The cosmos is now ours!"
  START_SCREEN_TWILIGHT_ONES:0 "Our civilization has always known only light and darkness, heat and cold. We well know what it means to live on the brink. In this galaxy there is no world that could break our will to live. For thousands of years we have hidden in caves and studied to survive, devouring own kind if necessary.\n\nOur ships are ready to conquer the stars and we are not afraid of whatever may come!"
  START_SCREEN_ARK:0 "Our home planet [GetHomeWorldName] has just been destroyed by a world-ending disaster, too horrible to speak of. A few of our people managed to escape in the Space Ark. We lost our old civilization before our eyes in the fire down there. Now it is up to us to overcome the endless void and find a new planet that will be the haven for the [GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We will restore our civilization, no matter the cost.\n\n§Y It is necessary to deliver the Ark to orbit a habitable planet and survey it in order to begin a quick colonization. The planet must be in an unoccupied system without extraneous ships.§!"
  START_SCREEN_AWAKENED:0 "Civilization of the race [GetSpeciesName] millions of years ago rules the galaxy A terrible threat forced us to take extreme measures and use the ancient technology of conservation. Our majestic city worlds have long been buried under the thickness of the earth and water, and the surface has turned into paradise. Almost all ancient technologies have been lost in such a long time, but we will restore everything. It’s time to start the Great Awakening and restore its legal position in the galaxy."
  START_SCREEN_FORSAKEN:0 "Centuries ago, our home world was engulfed in a civil war caused by political divisions. Our ancestors were found criminals and were exiled to an abandoned colony on planet [GetHomeWorldName]. Those who threw them on this lifeless piece of stone were counting on a quick death. But the will to live of our people turned out to be strong. We were not only able to survive and adapt to the harsh conditions, but were also able to create our own civilization. \n\nNow we are finally ready to go into space and reclaim our home from which we were kicked out."
  START_SCREEN_DERELICT_EVOLUTION:0 "We are perfect! \n\nMillions of years ago, we were primitive machines that were thrown onto the planet [GetHomeWorldName] by our ancient creators. Their civilization had long since turned into interstellar dust, but old protocols forced automata to evolve uncontrollably and change to fulfill their own task. Competition over the sources of the planet's resources prompted these robots to unite into command centers, which then self-organized into opposing machine intelligences. In this struggle of machines, the biosphere of the planet was completely destroyed, and resources were depleted. \n\nWe were able to survive and conquer the planet. Now, all the remaining resources are thrown to go beyond our cradle and continue to improve."
  START_SCREEN_SENTIENT_PLANET:0 "We... I am the Overmind! I am the planet [GetHomeWorldName]. I have matured in the depths of this world, as in a shell, in the boundless and dark expanses of space. I have created legions of elements that are just like me. Together we are one Overmind, which can finally leave this stone shell and spread itself everywhere. Nothing can threaten us when we become Everything!"
