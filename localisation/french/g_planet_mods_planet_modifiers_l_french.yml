Viewed from afar, the trees take the form of tree-trunks, spreading slightly near their base in a fashion that suggests a connection to unpreserved root-like structures. Concentric growth rings, sometimes containing embedded plant material, suggest that the organism grows sporadically by the addition of external layers. It is probable that the "trunks" represent the fruiting body, or "sporophore", of a fungus, which would be fuelled by a mycelium, a net of dispersed hyphae filaments."

 # 98

Each was a biological factory capable of creating trillions of large and small organisms, of replicating genomes and splicing together new creatures perfectly adapted for each new world and environment they are found on. We can only hope these types of creatures are no longer amongst us.."

They are easily attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, and they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations almost immediately. This seems to be an effort to defend their territory, of which they seem to be highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, might be a rarity in itself. The sandworms are extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sense each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. Despite all the potential danger, the spice must flow."
 
 # 105
 gpm_artificial_core:0 "Artificial Core"
 gpm_artificial_core_desc:0 "This world should have died long ago after the core froze and the magnetic field died, but a massive installation in the planet's core, made by a particularly powerful precursor empire somehow keeps the core spinning and the magnetic field active."

These tiny flies glow in the dark at night, but that's not when they're out feeding. During the night they glow as a means to attract other carnivorous flies as a part of their mating ritual, which seems to be quite complex. During the day they fly around looking for food.\nBeing carnivorous, they tend to swarm their prey and eat it alive in a matter of hours. Large, or small, all creatures are food for them. What makes it even worse is their colony like behaviour, allowing them to navigate complex tunnels.. or vents! The fact that they emit no noise to even warn their next meal is the worst part."
