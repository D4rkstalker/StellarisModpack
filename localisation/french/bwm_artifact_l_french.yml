 bwm_artifact.52.desc:0 "Our away team entered the station, the place is desolate and appears to have been long since abandoned. The structure is made up of small enclosed rooms with corridors of varying heights, which is hampering progress.\n\nWe eventually managed to restore power to some minor systems in what we suspect to be a control room and have unearthed several pieces of information about this solar system and the research conducted here. The most important being a central object in the system and three holding facilities in the nearby vicinity containing similiar artifacts.\n\nAcquiring these three "ciphers" as they are called should be our priority if we plan to further study the main object. On the other hand some of our scientists suggested to not waste time with such a paper chase and try our luck with the main object immediately."

 bwm_artifact.64.desc:0 "Our Science team has finished their study of the artifact. From all the data available to us we now assume it is not native to our known universe. The technology is different from anything we have seen before. The material it is made of is in a state of constant flux since we powered it up.\n\nOur scientists came to the conclusion that this object is some form of explosive device. According to their estimations, it could obliterate an entire star cluster or even more. If they are correct, we may have found the most dangerous weapon our galaxy has ever seen."

 bwm_artifact.200.desc:0 "After observing the relic for the past few years and reading the research data on the station our scientists have made a breakthrough. The technology we have before us is less technical in nature than biological. All data leads to the assumption of these artifacts being alive, atleast to some degree.\n\nThe spherical objects inside each artifact seem to contain living energy. While being different to any other form of life we have yet encountered they seemingly try to leave the spheres without success.
