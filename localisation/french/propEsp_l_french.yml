 spyOpportunity.2.desc:0 "We have received a coded communique from a dissatisfied §S[spyOpportunityTarget.GetName]§! lead scientist looking to defect. Due to the nature of their work they are kept under close scrutiny at a discreet research lab on the planet §S[spyOpportunityTarget.Capital.GetName]§!.\nOur [Root.oppEvent_AorB] network operatives believe that we only have a small window of opportunity to extract the scientist before they are relocated somewhere more secure."

 spyOpportunity.2.a:0 "Gear up a strike team, extract them with force."
 spyOpportunity.2.b:0 "Gear up a covert infiltration team, carefully extract them."
 spyOpportunity.2.c:0 "It's not worth the risk, continue with the operation as normal."

#  spyOpportunity.2.name:0 "Scientist Defection"
#  spyOpportunity.2.desc:0 "§PComplication§!. Orbital imagery of the blacksite holding the defecting scientist has revealed a far higher security detail that we expected. Our operatives are in position and ready to begin the raid, but opposition will be strong."
#  spyOpportunity.2.a:0 "Go ahead with the operation."
#  spyOpportunity.2.b:0 "It's not worth the risk."

 spyOpportunity.3.name:0 "Opportunity - Scientist Defection"
 spyOpportunity.3.desc:0 "§PComplication§!. After blasting their way through to the main compound our operatives were encircled by the local defense force. They are currently engaged in a vicious firefight on all sides.\nThe operation commander has discreetly informed us of remote kill switches implanted in all of the operatives. We could activate these to prevent them from being captured or wait to see if they can pull out of this."
 spyOpportunity.3.a:0 "Trigger the switches, no chances."
 spyOpportunity.3.b:0 "Let's wait, give them a chance."

#  spyOpportunity.4.name:0 "Scientist Defection"
#  spyOpportunity.4.desc:0 "§RFailure§!. Our agents discovered our efforts, the kill switches failed, and they know that we tried to kill them. They fought their way out of the firefight and disappeared into the streets of §S[spyOpportunityTarget.Capital.GetName]§. We can surely expect revenge."

 saborepOpportunity.2.desc.b:0 "Terrible news, after leaking the details of the §S[spyOpportunityTarget.GetName]§! diplomat, many of our diplomatic contacts have voiced their displeasure with us.

The entire convoy was destroyed in the resulting explosion, with all of the visiting diplomats confirmed dead. \n\nThe §S[spyOpportunityTarget.GetAdjective]§! denied any responsibility for the attack, however we ensured that foreign investigators found certain 'evidence' of their involvement. \n\nThe §S[bombDiplomatsTarget_1.GetName]§! and the §S[bombDiplomatsTarget_2.GetName]§! have gained the humiliation casus belli against the [spyOpportunityTarget.GetAdjective], whose general diplomatic reputation has been significantly impacted."

 saborepOpportunity.6.desc:0 "§RMajor Failure!§!. Our sabotage operation has ended in disaster. The exact events are uncertain, but we believe that while preparing for their operation several agents were discovered smuggling the explosives onto a diplomats ship. In the ensuing shootout the explosives were detonated.\n\nSeveral other [Root.oppEvent_AorB] network agents were apprehended in the following security sweeps, along with logs and files which at the very least suggest our involvement.\n\nThe §S[spyOpportunityTarget.GetName]§! authorities have wasted no time in publicly spreading and condemning our involvement."

 studyTech_Opportunity.21.desc.c:0 "Coming in low to avoid perimetre sensors, several attack craft flown by our agents delivered devastating damage to the weapons research installation. The targets progress with this tech has been seriously set back."
 
 studyTech_Opportunity.21.desc.d:0 "The installations perimetres defences spotted our agents before they could get close enough to do any damage, though we were able to extract them without incident. The target has likely already relocated the weapons data somewhere more secure."
