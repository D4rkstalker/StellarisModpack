    # Abstract Physics Theory
    tech_abstract_1:0 "Abstract Physics Theory"
    tech_abstract_1_desc:0 "Some 'laws-of-physics-breaking' phenomenons may not be explainable with quantum-mechanical approaches. A new branch of physics called 'Abstract Physics', which uses extremely unconventional and abstract mathematical and physical approaches for problem-solving, may lead to the answers for even the most absurd physical phenomenons of the universe."

    tech_abstract_2:0 "Applied Abstract Physics"
    tech_abstract_2_desc:0 "The groundbreaking approaches of Abstract Physics are definitely aiding us well at explaining even the universe's most abstract phenomenons.

    # Negative Pressure Application
    tech_negative_pressure:0 "Negative Pressure Application"
    tech_negative_pressure_desc:0 "Negative pressure is a phenomenon that has occurred before at the quantum-mechanical cassimere-effect. There it manifests in form of vacuum energy, but is unfortunately uncontrollable. Applied Abstract Physics has lead to the discovery of alternative, more useful and better applicable ways to generate and control negative pressure. It could be used within various application fields, but particularly in the manipulation of ultra-high-intensity space-distortions, like black holes."

    tech_dm_injection_desc:0 "The enlargement of the $ehof_ehof$ will allow us, besides the application of negative pressure, to also inject $ehof_darkmatter$ into the black hole, whose properties will largely increase the efficiency of our $ehof_ehof$. The combination of negative pressure and $ehof_darkmatter$, will further stabilize the inflated $ehof_wormholes$."
    
    # Gravitational field control
    tech_grav_control:0 "Gravitational Field Control"
    tech_grav_control_desc:0 "Advances in abstract physics finally gave us dominion over gravitational field manipulation.

The gravielectromagnetic fields, vastly increase the efficiency of the inflation process and the combination of $ehof_darkmatter$ and negative pressure greatly decreases the probability for inaccuracies and increases possible destination possibilities."

    tech_prob_c_desc:0 "Unimaginably sensitive tachyon sensors, able to react and detect within a few thousands of planck times, are used to determine the target of a $ehof_wormhole$ before it even gets inflated by the $ehof_ehof$. This foreshadowing of wormhole targets, increases the security and precision of $ehof_ehof$ travel to an unforeseen magnitude. With this technology, our $ehof_ehof$ will be able to directly choose any destination in the galaxy, without any restrictions. Limitless possibilities await."

    # Vacuum Energy Density Resonance Stimulation
    tech_vedrs:0 "Vacuum Energy Density Resonance Stimulation"
    tech_vedrs_desc:0 "The secrets we've uncovered inside the Sphere lead to the development of large scale vacuum manipulation technologies. Oscillating tachyon field projection plates, which actively control the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the higgs-field in a localized volume, through vacuum energy density resonance stimulation. This creates a local space-time bubble with a decreased vacuum energy density, with different physical laws, which will allow our $ehof_ehof$ to create absolutely stable $ehof_wormholes$, which never collapse, and even $ehof_wormholes$ that can be held open permanently."
