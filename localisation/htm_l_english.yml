### TECHNOLOGIES ###

tech_htm_01:0 "Hypertraversal Manipulation Fundamentals"
tech_htm_01_desc:0 "Thousands of star systems lie outside the webwork of hyperlanes that dictate the ebb and flower of interstellar travel. Until now, these systems have remained out of reach, but promising new technologies offer the opportunity to bring them within our grasp."
tech_htm_02:0 "Hypertraversal Massive Attraction"
tech_htm_02_desc:0 "The Hypertraversal Dowser has sparked a revolution in discovery, but the original protocol is too weak to attract larger stellar bodies.  With new advancements, new solutions present themselves."
tech_htm_03:0 "Hypertraversal Exotic Attraction"
tech_htm_03_desc:0 "Studies in Massive Attraction unlocked access to larger stars than before, but only recent strides in Dark Matter Drawing have made joining more exotic stars possible."
tech_htm_04:0 "Hypertraversal Boring"
tech_htm_04_desc:0 "Discoveries in engineering massive structures have presented the opportunity for a generation of more precise Hypertraversal Attractors than the Dowser."

tech_unlock_htm_03_desc:0 "§HExotic Attraction§!\nAllows Hypertraversal Attractors to locate and connect §Mexotic§! class (Neutron, Pulsar, Black Hole) stars to the hyperlane network."
tech_unlock_htm_04_title:0 "§HUnlocks Megastructure:§! Hypertraversal Bore"
tech_unlock_htm_04_desc:0 "§HHypertraversal Bore§!\nPerforms the same functions as the Hypertraversal Dowser, but with only a single hyperlane connection to the source system opened."
