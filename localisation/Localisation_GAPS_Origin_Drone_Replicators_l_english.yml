 Origin_GAPS_Drone_Replicators:0 "Drone Replicators"
 Origin_GAPS_Drone_Replicators_desc:0 "You are able to replicate drones with special starbase modules. You are only friendly with replicated drones and not the base drones. You get access to special projects that will upgrade your drone production. Your techs help buff your drones and give massive resource production in systems associated with drones."
