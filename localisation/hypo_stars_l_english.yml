 pc_blue_dwarf_star:0 "Blue Dwarf Star"
 pc_blue_dwarf_star_desc:1 "When a class M red dwarf with less than 0.25 solar masses has exhausted much of its hydrogen through fusion, instead of growing in size into a red giant, it becomes hotter to mantain the thermodynamic equilibrium, thus turning into a blue dwarf."
 sc_blue_dwarf_star:0 "§HBlue Dwarf Star§!"
 
 pc_black_dwarf_star:0 "Black Dwarf Star"
 pc_black_dwarf_star_desc:1 "This is the final stage of evolution of a white dwarf; after more than 10^15 years, its surface temperature will be less than 5K (-268ºC), thus radiating much less energy and heat, slowly turning into a black dwarf."
 sc_black_dwarf_star:0 "§HBlack Dwarf Star§!"
 
 pc_dark_star:0 "Dark Star"
 pc_dark_star_desc:1 "Also called dark matter stars, these stars were born in the early Universe before conventional stars were able to form. They are mostly composed of baryonic matter, but its dark matter component generates enough heat to prevent nuclear fusion to happen, turning them almost invisible to the naked eye."
 sc_dark_star:0 "§HDark Star§!"
 
 pc_quasi_star:0 "Quasi-Star"
 pc_quasi_star_desc:1 "Also called black hole stars, these very massive stars were formed in the early Universe, when the core of a large protostar collapsed into a black hole, but its outer layers contained the resulting burst of energy that would end up in a supernova in normal conditions. Then the infalling material into the Black Hole core generates enough radiation pressure to compensate the gravitational collapse and mantain in equilibrium the star."
 sc_quasi_star:0 "§HQuasi-Star§!"
 
 pc_strange_star:0 "Strange Star"
 pc_strange_star_desc:1 "Some neutron stars are massive enough that the neutrons in their cores disintegrate into quarks, turning into Quark Stars, but under very high pressures, half of the up quarks that form neutrons might be converted into strange quarks. If this occurs throughout the whole volume of the star, it is renamed as strange star."
 sc_strange_star:0 "§HStrange Star§!"
 
 pc_white_hole:0 "White Hole"
 pc_white_hole_desc:1 "This is a region of spacetime in which all time-like trajectories flow outwards, this is, that nothing can enter it from the outside, although matter and light can escape from it. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole, from which matter and light cannot escape."
 sc_white_hole:0 "§HWhite Hole§!"
 
 
 q_star:0 "Q-Star"
 q_star_desc:0 "This is, actually, not a black hole, but a very dense neutron star made of exotic matter, sometimes called a grey hole."
 
 intermediate_black_hole:0 "Intermediate mass black hole"
 intermediate_black_hole_desc:0 "This is a black hole more massive than a stellar black hole, but less massive than a supermassive black hole such as the ones at the centers of the galaxies. They have three proposed origins. The first one states that they could have been formed by two or more merging stellar black holes. The second one proposes the collision of massive stars in stellar clusters. And the third one states that they are primordial black holes fromed during the Big Bang."
 
 pop_iii_star:0 "Population III star"
 pop_iii_star_desc:0 "This star belongs to the first generation of stars formed in the Universe, thus containing very few heavy elements."
 
 tz_object:0 "Thorne-Zytkow object"
 tz_object_desc:0 "This red giant has a neutron star at its core, which it acquired by a collision between the two."
 
 electroweak_star:0 "Electroweak star"
 electroweak_star_desc:0 "The temperature at the center of this star is so high that the conditions there are such that the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force are combined, resulting in electroweak burning. This transforms the quarks at the core into leptons, producing just enough radiation pressure to stop the gravitational collapse of its core."
 
 sr_strange_matter:0 "Strange Matter"
 sr_strange_matter_desc:0 "The most stable form of matter in the Universe, obtained from Strange Stars."
 
 sr_quark_gluon_plasma:0 "Quark-Gluon Plasma"
 sr_quark_gluon_plasma_desc:0 "This form of matter resembles the state of the very early Universe. It is found at the core of Quark Stars."
 
 tech_mine_quark_gluon_plasma:0 "Quark-Gluon plasma extraction"
 tech_mine_quark_gluon_plasma_desc:0 "The method of extracting Quark-Gluon plasma from the cores of quark stars permits to study in detail the conditions of the early Universe."
 
 tech_mine_strange_matter:0 "Strange Matter recollection"
 tech_mine_strange_matter_desc:0 "The understanding of the most stable form of matter in the Universe allows for the construcion of stronger structures both in space and on land."

 sr_antimatter:0 "Antimatter"
 sr_antimatter_desc:0 "It behaves in the exact same manner that regular matter, but has an opposite electric charge. If it comes into contact with regular matter, both annihilate releasing photons."
 
 tech_mine_antimatter:0 "Antimatter extrication"
 tech_mine_antimatter_desc:0 "Newly found methods can succesfully extract antimatter from antimatter stars for its use in weaponry and research."
 
 pc_antimatter_star:0 "Antimatter Star"
 pc_antimatter_star_desc:1 "It looks like regular star at first glance, but it is in fact made of antimatter, so it reacts violently to any matter that comes near it."
 sc_antimatter_star:0 "Antimatter Star"
 
 quark_star:0 "Quark Star"
 quark_star_desc:0 "The conditions of temperature and pressure at the core of this neutron star are sufficiently high as to unbound the neutrons into their fundamental components: quarks up and down and gluons, forming what is called a quark-gluon plasma."

 edict_strange_matter_alloys_research_desc:0 "With the extraction and study of strange matter, we can upgrade the armour of our ships."
 edict_antimatter_explosives_research:0 "Antimatter explosives research"
 edict_antimatter_explosives_research_desc:0 "We can exploit the volatile nature of antimatter to produce better explosives."
 edict_quantum_physics_research:0 "Quantum physics research"
 edict_quantum_physics_research_desc:0 "If we accumulate enough quark-gluon plasma, further experiments can be performed, which would expand our understanding of quantum field theory."
