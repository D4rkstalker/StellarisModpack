### TECHNOLOGIES ###

tech_htm_01:0 "Hypertraversal Manipulation Fundamentals"
tech_htm_01_desc:0 "Recent advances in our grasp of hyperspace have permitted us a glimpse in how to master the lanes rather than just use them.  A revolutionary new prototype ship offers the promise to allow us to sculpt the hyperlanes to our will."
tech_htm_02:0 "Hypertraversal Extra-Network Connection"
tech_htm_02_desc:0 "Thousands of star systems lie outside the webwork of hyperlanes that dictate the ebb and flower of interstellar travel. Until now, these systems have remained out of reach, but promising new technologies offer the opportunity to bring them within our grasp."
tech_htm_03:0 "Hypertraversal Massive Attraction"
tech_htm_03_desc:0 "The Hyperspace Augur has sparked a revolution in discovery, but the original protocol is too weak to attract larger stellar bodies.  With new advancements, new solutions present themselves."
tech_htm_04:0 "Hypertraversal Exotic Attraction"
tech_htm_04_desc:0 "Studies in Massive Attraction unlocked access to larger stars than before, but only recent strides in Dark Matter Drawing have made joining more exotic stars possible."
tech_htm_05:0 "Hypertraversal Boring"
tech_htm_05_desc:0 "Discoveries in engineering massive structures have presented the opportunity to refine the attraction process, connecting a single system with a single hyperlane without the collateral connections."
tech_htm_06:0 "Hypertraversal Network Severance"
tech_htm_06_desc:0 "Disruptive shattering of the local hyperspace network to isolate a system may provide interesting new opportunities both civic and martial."
tech_htm_07:0 "Hypertraversal Advanced Boring"
tech_htm_07_desc:0 "More sensitive and powerful uses of the Augur will allow us to better pinpoint desirable systems in a specific direction."
tech_htm_08:0 "Hypertraversal Subspace Ripping"
tech_htm_08_desc:0 "With massive power expenditure, the Augur can tear a hole through subspace to connect to distant, uncharted star systems."
