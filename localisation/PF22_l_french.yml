Much of the central neural nexus remained withered and calcified after the recovery, relying on smaller instinctual neural nodes for decision making. This likely lead to significantly reduced higher-level reasoning and their outwardly hostile stance involving it's feeding instinct.\n\nFinally, there is strong evidence of a prior cataclysmic battle in this satellite galaxy, which destroyed the sentry array and nearly annihilated the home world, explaining it's state of decay.
