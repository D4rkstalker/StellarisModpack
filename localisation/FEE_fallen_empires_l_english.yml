 fallen_empires_awakening.7.name:0 "The Hive Awakes"
 fallen_empires_awakening.7.desc:0 "It began as a series of very weak telepathic pulses emanating from §H[From.GetAdjective]§! space. Barely noticeable celestial oddities we called it, recording their detection and then forgetting all about it. Up until recently, it was beyond meaningless. It was only when the pulses become screams that we took notice. For the first time in eons, the §H[From.GetName]§! are waking up, shaking off their lethargy and rousing to full consciousness. The Hive Mind is gathering all its strength to it, enervating the multitudes of drones lying dormant and tasking them to the restoration of §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§! military power. The intent of the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§! remains unknown, but with other precursor empires abroad in the galaxy once more, this event is surely not a coincidence."
 fallen_empires_awakening.7.a:0 "A Swarm resurgent..."
 
 fallen_empires_awakening.11.name:0 "Stirring in the Dark"
 fallen_empires_awakening.11.spiritualist.desc:0 "For years, our psionic choirs have been detecting very strong psionic activity emanating from §H[From.GetAdjective]§! space, much more powerful than we have ever recorded before. But what we are detecting now is highly disturbing. All of our people are feeling it, a dull pain in their heads. For our more gifted psionic individuals, the sensation is unbearable and potentially dangerous - the Shroud is screaming in pain, and the intensity of the feedback is such that we have lost many of our psionics to sudden and lethal brain hemorrhaging. Now we understand why. The §H[From.GetName]§! are waking up for the first time in millenia; suddenly millions of minds and souls are actively engaging with the Shroud once more. Our most learned clerics postulate that the vast and rapid accumulation of psionic power has damaged the Shroud, unleashing some sort of §MPsionic Storm§! upon the galaxy, and now we suffer the consequences on the spiritual plane, as surely as we shall do on the physical plane."
 fallen_empires_awakening.11.default.desc:0 "It began as a dramatic shift in §H[From.GetAdjective]§! behavior. The [From.GetSpeciesName] have been preparing, collecting information, powering up old foundries, recovering mothballed fleets and most disturbing of all, unleashing some sort of vicious psychological weapon on the galaxy. All organic species has felt a discomfort, a dull pain in the back of their heads that refuses to go away and baffles our medical experts. The mystics in our society liken it to a so-called §MPsionic Storm§!, ravaging the wavelengths that the mind is attuned to. Whatever the explanation, what matters is that for the first time in an age, the §H[From.GetName]§! are looking outwards beyond their borders and towards the galaxy at large.\n\nAs their decaying shipyards are repaired and refitted and the dormant systems of Titan foundries come online, the rest of the galaxy is left with only one question - who will this once-sleeping giant target first in their quest to reclaim age-old glory lost?"
 fallen_empires_awakening.11.a:0 "A storm is coming..."
 fallen_empires_awakening.11.effects.tooltip:0 "As the psionic storm intensifies, we may suffer the consequences..."
 
 FEE_awakened.2.title:0 "Militarist Superstate"
 FEE_awakened.2.desc:0 "The awakening of the §H[From.GetName]§! was not by accident, nor have they been completely idle all these years. They have been exerting their influence through their subject, the §R[MilitaristPuppet.GetName]§! whilst at the same concealing a great military buildup from the rest of the galaxy, stockpiling materiel and ships. Now, the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§! have unified as one, resurgent as a superpower once more. This was not a happenstance; this was their plan all along."
 FEE_awakened.2.a:0 "A new power is at hand..."
 
 FEE_awakened.3.title:0 "Assertions of Supremacy"
 FEE_awakened.3.desc:0 "When the awakening of the §H[From.GetName]§! occurred, we expected a response befitting their status and personality. We have been disappointed. So far the §H[From.GetName]§! have done little but paw over the remains of their long dead empire. Recently however, we have received messages from §H[From.GetAdjective]§! ambassadors, claiming that a fully restored §H[From.GetName]§! is at hand, and warning of great peril for all who oppose them."
 FEE_awakened.3.a:0 "Platitudes, or promises?" 
 
# Spiritualist Events
 
 FEE_awakened.303.title:0 "Communication from §H[FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName]§!"
 FEE_awakened.303.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], we have a request of you. Well, it is a request only in some much as you have a choice to refuse it, but we do not have the choice to accept your refusal. Our gods have contacted us through the veil; they are hungry and demand a sacrifice. For reasons our covenant forbids us to reveal, this sacrifice must be of a young race. One soul does not equal another however, and you can either choose to send us a single leader of your kind, or a flock of your plebeians, either will satisfy our masters. The appeasement of the divines cannot wait, what say you?"
 FEE_awakened.303.a:0 "You may take a leader."
 FEE_awakened.303.a.tooltip:0 "§H[AscendedSpiritualistLeaderTarget.GetName]§! will be taken and sacrificed by the §H[FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName]§!."
 FEE_awakened.303.b: "We offer you some of our people."
 FEE_awakened.303.b.tooltip: "A §H[Root.GetSpeciesName] Pop§! will be taken from your empire and sacrificed by the §H[FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName]§!."
 FEE_awakened.303.c: "We will never surrender our people to the slaughter!"
 FEE_awakened.306.title:0 "The End Times"
 FEE_awakened.306.desc:0 "With the onset of the galactic crisis, the more spiritually inclined of the galaxy's people have been proclaiming the end of the days, shrieking that the destruction of the galaxy is at hand. For the fanatics of the §B[From.GetName]§!, the crisis merely reinforced their long held belief that the galaxy has become impure, and divine judgement is upon us. We received the following transmission from the §B[From.GetAdjective]§! ruler:\n §EThe apocalypse is upon us. This is the will of the divine, and yet you, and others like you, have decided to fight the instruments of the End Times, in an attempt to halt the inevitable. We are not willing to risk any interference in bringing about the end, so we have taken matters into our own hands. We have formed a covenant with §YThe End of the Cycle§E and have thus ensured that the apocalypse comes to pass. Judgment has been passed, and you have been found wanting."
 FEE_awakened.306.a: "The End is nigh!"
 FEE_awakened.306.b: "Magic nonsense."
 FEE_awakened.306.c: "Should we be worried?"
 
 
 FEE_crisis.3.title:0 "Psionic Storm Claims Victims"
 FEE_crisis.3.desc:0 "The §MPsionic Storm§! has been ravaging the minds of our psionic population without mercy, and there is only so much we can do to protect them from the debilitating effect it has on mind and body. Unfortunately, we have just lost countless lives on §Y[FEEPsionicPopDeathPlanet.GetName]§! to the storm. A full count of the dead has not yet been completed, but reports say thousands of men and women screamed until their vocal chords burst, tearing their eyes out of their sockets, and then expiring from intense brain hemorrhaging. We have to devise some way of stopping this storm or more will die."
 FEE_crisis.3.a: "Those poor people..."
 FEE_crisis.4.a.tooltip: "A Psionic Pop on [FEEPsionicPopDeathPlanet.GetName] §Rdies§!."
 FEE_crisis.4.title:0 "Psionic Storm Drives Leader Insane"
 FEE_crisis.4.desc:0 "The §MPsionic Storm§! claws at the minds of our people, afflicting them with nightmares, diabolical visions and in some cases, neurological damage. We can only do so much to shield our people from the storm, and it seems that we have to record another victim of this crisis. §Y[FEEPsionicLeaderDeath]§! recently suffered a complete mental breakdown, attacking his peers and colleagues without restraint, committing self-harm with vicious abandon, screaming unendingly the whole time. Despite our best efforts, we could not save [FEEPsionicLeaderDeath.GetHerHim]. We must act to stop this storm before more die."
 FEE_crisis.4.a:0 "What a horrible way to go."
 FEE_crisis.4.tooltip:0 "[FEEPsionicLeaderDeath] §Rdies§!."
 FEE_crisis.5.title:0 "Psionic Storm Intensifies"
 FEE_crisis.5.desc:0 "As if our current predicament could not get any worse, all our information indicates that the §MPsionic Storm§! has gotten worse. Our psionically attuned population is at even greater risk of suffering the ill effects of this violent cataclysm, and with no signs of abating yet, we may only be seeing the beginning of a disaster on a galactic scale."
 FEE_crisis.5.a:0 "What can be done?"
 FEE_crisis.6.title:0 "Psionic Storm Becomes Cataclysm"
 FEE_crisis.6.desc:0 "As we predicted, the §MPsionic Storm§! has intensified further, becoming a truly devastating galactic event. Psionic populations are being killed off en-masse by this raging tempest, and although current indications show it is not getting any worse, it is hard to imagine how much worse it can possibly get. If we do not act now, it has every potential to drag us into the abyss too, with or without psionics of our own."
 FEE_crisis.6.a:0 "Are we doomed?"
 FEE_crisis.8.title:0 "Psionic Storm Abates"
 FEE_crisis.8.desc:0 "With the destruction of those responsible for its creation, the so-called §MPsionic Storm§! has seemingly abated. Whether the galaxy will ever truly recover from such a vicious and unrelenting assault on the minds of its people is unclear. The ability to harm people and generate such upheaval from great distance is unsettling at best - we must ensure that if it ever happens again, we shall be ready to stand against the storm."
 FEE_crisis.8.a:0 "Is it really over?"
