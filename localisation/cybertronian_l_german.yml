The Autobots have since fled the system in their pitiful glorified cargo hauler, the so-called 'Ark' and now Cybertron is mine to command! My victory marks a brilliant new beginning for Cybertron. Decepticons, it is time to expand my empire across the galaxy so that all shall fear my name! ALL HAIL MEGATRON!"

Untainted by the foolish and antiquated ideals of the Autobots from which I shall rule a vast Decepticon empire free from weakness and inhibition for all of eternity! ALL HAIL MEGATRON!"

The planet has been inhabited by our kind for millions of years. Throughout our long and prosperous history, we have seen many ages of conflict and peace. However, we are now nearing the end of another golden era. The building corruption and social stratification during the Age of Rust have reduced our society into rigidity and stagnation, sparking rising unrest. I fear that if nothing is done, it may soon lead to civil war on Cybertron..."

The origins of our world and its people date back to the time of Primus, our creator, used the AllSpark to populate our planet with life creating the first cybertronians.

 vector_sigma.2.name: "The Key to Vector Sigma"
 vector_sigma.2.desc: "Following my previous report on the abandoned crypt, it appears to have once belonged to a revered cybertronian native of cultural significance. Based on our translations, several of these large statues surrounding the crypt depict the original thirteen primes, perhaps their leaders or deities. Whoever they are, this site may have some connection to the energy readings we've been receiving. Upon closer inspection of the crypt's interior, we have found a mysterious glowing key under the rubble beneath a pile of rusted mechanical parts and broken statues. We believe this key may be tied to a native legend translated from the texts we uncovered near the digsite of a §YVector Sigma§!. The key's pulsating glow matches the frequency of the anomaly and it seems to be guiding south towards the outskirts of a city known as Kaon. After a long journey across this wasteland, we arrived at what appears to be an abandoned arena. While preparing our equipment to scan the area, another massive crypt rose from the ground, destroying the arena in response to the key. We lost one of our team members standing too close to the structure. However, this crypt opened a passageway that leads underground. We are preparing the excavation team to venture into the passage using the key as our guide."

One of our scientists reluctantly touched the ancient console which activated the room. The chamber shifted and a blinding bright light illuminated the dark room. This appears to be origin of the the signal anomaly. Now we must find a way to activate the console using the key..."

Our scientists attempted to communicate with the sentient computer and we seem to have made an agreement. Vector Sigma will allow us to access its databanks in exchange for a resource called §Yenergon§!. It stated that as long as the key remains in our possession, Vector Sigma will comply with our orders."

 #START SCREEN MESSAGES
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_MAXIMAL: "Cybertron, our home.\n\nAfter the end of the Great War between the Autobots and Decepticons, we have turned our attention towards rebuilding our civilization. Over time, with an end to the hostilities between the two factions, we have achieved a lasting peace under the Pax Cybertronia treaty.\n\nWithout hostilities, most cybertronians underwent the Great Upgrade that downsized our bodies into more fuel-efficient forms. The Autobots and Decepticons soon became our ancestors of the Maximals and Predacons. With our past behind us, we Maximals, now look forward towards future exploration of new civilizations, science, and arts." 
 
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_PREDACON: "Cybertron, our home.\n\nAfter the Autobots won the Great War and the signing of the Pax Cybertronia treaty, we Predacons, descendants of the mighty Decepticons have become nothing more than second-class citizens under the boot of the Maximals.\n\nAlthough many cybertronians have underwent the Great Upgrade to downsize our bodies into more fuel-efficient forms, we Predacons still live for the glory of battle.\n\nNow we are ruled by the Tripredacas Council, one of the the stronger factions among the Predacon Alliance that is all too eager to serve the will of the Maximals, making schemes in the dark rather than to serving our interests for conquest.\n\nOne day, like our Decepticon ancestors, we will rise again to reclaim Cybertron for ourselves and restart the Great War with the Predacons as the true victors.\n\nYes..." 
 
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_VEHICON: "Cybertron, my world.\n\nThe Beast Wars are over, the Maximals have lost and only I remain.\n\nI, Megatron, have assumed my rightful place as ruler of Cybertron. I have excised the organic rot of Beast modes and have returned Cybertron to its pristine metallic form. As a gesture of mercy, I have removed the sparks of all cybertronians on Cybertron, freeing them from the burden of individuality and had their bodies scrapped and reformatted into vehicons, my personal army of obedient drones that will soon spread my will across the stars.\n\nNow with my imminent ascendance to godhood, I believe it is time for conquest! Yesss...\n\nCybertron was just the beginning! Soon I shall remake this galaxy into my image and bring about the end of all organic life!"

Every intelligent creature turns its tools to murder eventually. I am there, in the sweat and the blood, and the inertia of an action that once done cannot be undone.\n\n I am hunger. The energy released by a life extinguished is my food, strife the wine with which I drink it down. The geography of dreams deferred and love unrequited mirror the sublime hills and valleys of my brainwaves. I am the dense, unfathomable insanity of a possessed mind.\n\n Entropy, decay, death are things of the natural order, corporeal facsimiles of my will. I am beyond such things. I am no mere force of nature. No phenomenon to be studied, codified, and circumvented by the inventiveness of lesser beings. I am the collapse of natural order.
