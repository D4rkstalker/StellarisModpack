 # Decisions
 ###################################################
 
 decision_subterranean_construction:0 "Subterranean Cities"
 decision_subterranean_construction_desc:0 "We need more room for our people. Lay plans for an underground metropolis. Windows are overrated. \n§YProvides bonus resources, science, or defense§! \nMore effective on larger worlds."
 decision_sky_construction:0 "Sky Islands"
 decision_sky_construction_desc:0 "We will live in the sky and look down upon those beneath us, no matter the expense. \n§YProvides bonus trade, growth, unity, or influence§! \nMore effective on smaller worlds."
 
 subterranean_city_unlock: "§HUnlocks Decision:§! §E$decision_subterranean_construction$§!"
 subterranean_city_effect: "Grants extra districts, planet bonuses and jobs. More effective on larger worlds."
 sky_island_unlock: "§HUnlocks Decision:§! §E$decision_sky_construction$§!"
 sky_island_effect: "Grants extra districts, planet bonuses and jobs. More effective on smaller worlds."

 decision_subterranean_expansion: "Subterranean Expansion"
 decision_subterranean_expansion_desc: "Expand our Underground City. Increases districts by 1 less than the last expansion, provides additional subterranean jobs, but will not change the subterranean planet modifier."
 decision_subterranean_expansion_2: "Final Subterranean City Expansion"
 decision_subterranean_expansion_2_desc: "$decision_subterranean_expansion_desc$"

 decision_sky_expansion: "Sky Island Expansion"
 decision_sky_expansion_desc: "Expand our Floating City. Increases districts by 1 less than the last expansion, provides additional sky jobs, but will not change the sky island planet modifier."
 decision_sky_expansion_2: "Final Sky Island Expansion"
 decision_sky_expansion_2_desc: "$decision_sky_expansion_desc$"
 
 decision_reopen_foundry:0 "Reopen Our Foundry"
 decision_reopen_foundry_desc:0 "Closing the foundry was a drastic step, the time has come to open its doors once again"
 decision_investigate_foundry: "$foundry_investigation$"
 decision_investigate_foundry_desc: "$foundry_investigation_desc$"
 decision_safety_protocols:0 "Enable Safety Protocols"
 decision_safety_protocols_desc:0 "Foundry operations carry a small risk of causing planet disintegration. Simple measures have been taken to ensure your safety, including mandatory 2 hour lunch breaks"
 decision_disable_protocols:0 "Disable Safety Protocols"
 decision_disable_protocols_desc:0 "Production quotas are far more important than worker safety. \n\n§YRisk of seismic disturbances. Chance of catastrophic §Rplanetary fractures§Y increases each time this planet has a seismic event.§!"


 foundry_investigation:0 "Investigate seismic disturbances"
 foundry_investigation_DESC:0 "We should open an investigation of the theoretical link between earthquakes and foundry operations. Foundry operators maintain that this is not an admission of guilt, but a fact finding mission. All workers signed liability waivers, so we dont need to worry about "rights" or "lawsuits"."
 research_fracture: "Draft a solution to the Foundry Fracture Crisis"
 research_fracture_DESC: "How did it come to this? What can we do? Is all hope lost? No ideas are bad ideas, we must come up with a plan of action."
 seal_fracture: "Seal the Fracture"
 seal_fracture_DESC: "In theory we could attempt to use subterranean resonance emitters in an effort to shake the fractured planetary crust back into place. A reverse earthquake if you will. It would require incredibly detailed sensor readings, a massive outlay of power, and a fair bit of luck. If successful, we could return [Root.Planet.GetName] to its state before this catastrophe, and perhaps one day we could even rebuild our subterranean complex and reinforce it against future failures. §GHigh§! Chance of Success."
 contain_fracture: "Contain the Fracture"
 contain_fracture_DESC: "We will simply try to contain the damage. If we were to seal every surface fracture with enough materials, and detonate a series of concentrated charges to collapse the former foundry main chamber we might be able to plug the original core containment breach before it spreads across the entire surface. Unfortunately this will do nothing about the ash cloud, and [Root.Planet.GetName] will never be the same again. §YModerate§! Chance of Success."
 ignore_fracture: "Minimize The Damage"
 ignore_fracture_DESC: "The forces at work on [Root.Planet.GetName] are far to great for us to control. The best we can do is shut down what portions of the forges we can still reach, and allow nature to take its course. §RLow§! Chance of Success."

 masterclearance_increase_size_0:0 "Increase max districts by §R0§!. \n$TIME_DELAY$."
 masterclearance_increase_size_1:0 "Increase max districts by §G1§!. \n$TIME_DELAY$."
 masterclearance_increase_size_2:0 "Increase max districts by §G2§!. \n$TIME_DELAY$."
 masterclearance_increase_size_3:0 "Increase max districts by §G3§!. \n$TIME_DELAY$."
 masterclearance_increase_size_4:0 "Increase max districts by §G4§!. \n$TIME_DELAY$."

 land_clearance_first:0 "§RWe should build on all open land before we consider such a grand project.§!"
 one_percent_already:0 "The wealthiest members of our society already have a home. They request never to be bothered again."
 land_clearance_construction_first:0 "§ROur top engineers are already busy with a major construction project. You do want our best engineers for such a ambitious project don't you?§!"
 
 ban_already:0 "There is nothing more to ban"
 investigation_already:0 "We have already issued a special project to investigate the unconfirmed link between seismic disturbances and the Foundry. Link remains unconfirmed. This is fine."
 safety_cooldown:0 "We can only change safety protocols once every six months. Otherwise it gets confusing"

 # Special Projects
 ###################################################
 foundry_investigation:0 "Seismic Study"
 foundry_investigation_desc:0 "We must determine if there is any connection between recent earthquakes and Foundry operations. Such a connection is purely conjecture, and this study is in no way an admission of guilt or liability. All persons have waived their rights to legal action by living here, via the End User Living Agreement (EULA)."
 seal_fracture:0 "Seal the Breach"
 seal_fracture_desc:0 "We must find a way to stop the core fracture from spreading. Seismic readings indicate that the damage is expanding far beyond the reach of our former foundry, in fact the entire planetary crust could best be described as crumbling. If nothing is done, the entire planet may be rendered uninhabitable."

While some residents may complain of local tremors and ground displacement, the occasional collapsed city block is a small price to pay for progress. Now, what should our subterranean city become? \n\nOur Generals have proposed a nearly impenetrable underground fortress with enough food and capacity to shelter the more important members of society should our world ever suffer from orbital bombardment. However our head of engineering has proposed a radical geothermal foundry that could revolutionize planetary production methods. \n\nA few fringe environmental groups have raised objections to this idea on the grounds that upsetting planetary tectonics might have unforeseen consequences, while local representatives of the artisan troupe have petitioned that the sulfur fumes of the forges would ruin their olfactory artwork. However, these naysayers are of little importance, so what shall we build?"

Excess material is vented through surface ducts, a practice that is probably completely safe, at least according to the scientists whose research we pay for. \n\nWhile there is no proven connection to the refinery, [Root.Planet.GetName] residents have grown more reluctant go outside, citing poor air quality. This is probably just an excuse latched on to by the less productive members of society to demand larger living spaces. There have also been a few isolated incidents of "Red Vessel Disease," a condition that allegedly arises from exposure to concentrated mote dust, a biproduct of the refining process. Legal experts assure us that thanks to predatory contract law, the refinery bears no liability or responsibility whatsoever. The real tragedy is that we are wasting precious mote dust that careless workers might accidentally inhale or otherwise absorb.

 MasterNature_event.33.desc:0 "Whether by greed or gross negligence, senior foundry engineering staff have been admitted that they sometimes ignore critical system warnings in an effort to maintain production quotas. In response to questioning, one staff member reported that they had no idea what would happen if the containment integrity system reached the red zone, but they would lose their job if they even considered cutting back production goals in the name of safety. This attitude of bottom line above all else permeates every level of foundry management. \n\nInvestigators report that ignoring safety mechanisms could be the cause of recent seismic activity and damage to planetary infrastructure. At worst, it could lead to a containment breach. What exactly a breach would mean is unclear, however one scientist said cryptically, "When there is nothing left to burn, you have to set the world on fire." \n\nThe committee has issued recommendations for new safety protocols. It could mean a net loss of production, But can you measure lives in alloys? Some claim that the recommended safety measures are superfluous, and as our production technology improves the risk of a catastrophic breach lessens. Regardless, the report is clearly damning to current senior engineering staff, and the public expects a strong response. Activists have demanded the resignation of Chief Engineer [foundry_engineer.GetName], and threaten legal action if their demands are not met."

Conditions on [Root.Planet.GetName] are dire, thousands of lives have been lost as super-heated metals breach the surface. Every effort to fight back the fires has proven futile as they are fueled directly by exposed magma that is creeping up through fractures in the foundry containment chamber. \n\nA growing ash cloud has blocked out the sun in the southern hemisphere, and is expected to fully encircle [Root.Planet.GetName] in a matter of days. That is not the most pressing problem however. Seismic readings indicate that the fractures are expanding far beyond the reach of our former foundry, in fact the entire planetary crust is crumbling. If nothing is done, the entire planet may be rendered uninhabitable."

 MasterNature_event.36.desc:0 "Our foundry cannot be saved, but maybe [Root.Planet.GetName] can. In theory we could attempt to use subterranean resonance emitters in an effort to shake the fractured planetary crust back into place. A reverse earthquake if you will. It would require incredibly detailed sensor readings, a massive outlay of power, and a fair bit of luck. If successful, we could return [Root.Planet.GetName] to its state before this catastrophe, and perhaps one day we could even rebuild our subterranean complex and reinforce it against future failures. \n\nAlternatively we could simply try to contain the damage. If we were to seal every surface fracture with enough materials, and detonate a series of concentrated charges to collapse the former foundry main chamber we might be able to plug the original core containment breach before it spreads across the entire surface. Unfortunately this will do nothing about the ash cloud, and [Root.Planet.GetName] will never be the same again."
