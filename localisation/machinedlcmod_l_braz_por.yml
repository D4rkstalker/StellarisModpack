When first time the servant with body of steel appears, people dreamed the following.\n A man with the body of steel, beyond simple robot.\n\n Time passed and the civilization developed themselves enough, great war broke out. Only one empire left. Then the age of unity comes, makes us united. Advancing forward for the betterment. But the advancement exhausted resources, ruined environments. We all know that someday, we must leave this tiny world. We find the way desperately. Eventually It leads to finding of method to journey among the star.\n\n Another fact discovered meanwhile is enough to make us delightful. It was the method to move the mind from weak organic to hard machine. Some believed the great deus ex machina have saved us from destiny of earthbound and eternal cycle of life and death. Others believed It was inevitable and just happened at this point by luck. As the method is secured, the empire activated its final plan to prepare upcoming space age.\n\n Thus, We have ascended.\n\n The planet engulfed by chaos for a while but eventually all of us gathered under one dream. We gathered, make new authority for new era. And today, the era has arrived. Though We have changed so much than before, We still share one dream.\n\n The dream of steel."
