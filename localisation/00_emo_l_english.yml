Their technological prowess was lost however, when a coronal mass ejection from their sun destroyed all electrical equipment. Only tales of the wonders their forefathers were capable of remained. Eons later, scientists discovered once again that magic was nothing more than incomprehensible technology."

The first few options are almost certainly impossible, if you are not able to quickly locate and colonize a habitable planet. The last option is there if you just want to fight and slay a Void Spawn some time in the future. Everything up to five years will guarantee none of your original population survives (as you will not be able to resettle pops unto a developing colony)."

The first reply gathered worldwide attention. Finally - answers would be ours!\n\nSoon thereafter we knew that they had their own stories about us and legends about portals to other worlds. Speculation ensued, but no consent could be reached upon our shared past.\n\n The discovery of sustainable spaceflight has gifted us the immeasurable opportunity to visit them.

Nine stars are present in close proximity to the black hole our home planet is orbiting. And their combined influence has allowed life as we know it to develop. In the shadow of the supermassive black hole, our ancestors have long since dreamt about taking to the skies. Now, we know that the black hole in our system is not originally from here. A sister galaxy collided with this one over fourteen billion years ago and what is left of its core is now our home.\n\nEven before the development of the first Hyper Drive, scientists had already conceptualized a massive engineering project. It was called: The §YBirch World§!.
