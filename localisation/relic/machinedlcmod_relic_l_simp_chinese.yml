 machinedlc_relic.1.desc:0 "The area we searched before is just only small part of the facility. Probe drones and equipments for additional survey are standing by, investigation for this underground building will be ready as long as the science ship is provided in high orbit with research commanding unit. We could find something more easily if the research commanding unit is working efficiently, therefore highly skilled one is recommended."
 machinedlc_relic.1.a:0 "Good, prepare commanding unit."
 machinedlc_relic.7.name:0 "The Unknown Coordinate"
 machinedlc_relic.7.desc:0 "We have found part of data from the drive. According to them, the machine intelligence once owned the drone storage was at war against certain alien faction. Anyway, I got the coordinate of related system from them. The location is not that far from our home world. We also gained hyperlane map so our ships can use it. We should send science ship to investigate it as soon as possible."

#digsite 1
 machinedlc_relic.2.name:0 "Army of Drones"
 machinedlc_relic.2.desc:0 " There are line of drones stood up aligned where the expedition units went down through the aisle. Every one of them are in deactivated state. and installed with specific equipment identically. What we have discovered through analysis is: \n\n These drones are all made for combat. The equipment must be a weapon. Its ability to concentrate energy to shoot something, and its various parts made to help aim something, clearly shows that it is designed for military purpose. Its power is not that high, but looks like its simple structure make it need less resources when production. \n\n Though the reason why combat drones are stored here is mystery. Maybe this place is a military facility owned by creators who disappeared after making us. What is more questioning is, these drones have similar internal structures with ours. We have spotted last terminal remaining in the place while investigation. The answer could exist in it."
 machinedlc_relic.2.a:0 "Recycle the equipment."
 machinedlc_relic.2.a.tooltip:0 "Effect of §H$mod_machine_drone_storage$§! planet modifier will be changed."
 machinedlc_relic.3.name:0 "Military Facility"
 machinedlc_relic.3.desc:0 " Most of data on the terminal were corrupted, as I expected. But only a handful of recoverable data were enough to figure out the situation. According to it, this facility is a military one. The record that other similar facilities were operated at the same time, suggests that preparation for situation like war was required. The moment when large forces are needed. \n\n Still who ordered to operate is still unknown, since the file is corrupted. They were here before us, so they could be our creators. But the evidence to prove it is not found. Every recoverable data left on the terminal were checked, I will move the expedition units to further down. There are probably something more we can search."
 machinedlc_relic.3.a:0 "Report me when you find out something."
 machinedlc_relic.4.name:0 "Determined Extermination"
 machinedlc_relic.4.desc:0 " Sir, I have discovered more data... out of my expectation. Right after we broke through collapsed aisle, I noticed there is an available console. I used it and was able to access the data archive. A record beyond my expectation was left there. Owner of this facility was a machine intelligence, just like us. \n\n Furthermore, there was a partially corrupted record that mentioning organics casualty. It includes casualty number of that moment and estimated time left before they extinct. We don't know what they mean, currently. \n\n Though analysis of secured data, shows the result that drone armies built in this place and organic casualty numbers are proportional. Surely we can't tell whether they have relationship or not. We just analyzed only comparable data among secured one. I will report you later with additional data."
 machinedlc_relic.4.a:0 "What happened there?"
 machinedlc_relic.5.name:0 "Pile of Corpses"
 machinedlc_relic.5.desc:0 " We found something in other accessible area. The organics, especially one that its life activity is stopped. Numerous organics are dead inside of some kind of devices. We searched them and detected that their entire circuit was fried for unknown reason. Yet, we haven't figured out the cause of their death or what those devices are made for. \n\n Passing through countless number of organics, we have secured a broken drone. It appears to be supervisor of the facility and its circuit was fried too. It is not possible to activate it again, but was able to disassemble it to obtain the data drive. That's all for now. We are analyzing data, and will report you when something worth to notice is found."
 machinedlc_relic.5.a:0 "It's definitely strange."

It's hailing us..."
