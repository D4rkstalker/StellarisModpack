Some combat drones are also present, very similarly built to our current models, but with the same advanced technology and systems.\n\nIt is currently unclear as to the reason for these battles, and it seems that they revolve around the organic's push towards the inner-most sections of the planet, further down into the corridors.

With the remains of some organics close to the door, it must have been closed as an option for last-defense against the invading organics.\n\nWe still have no clues as to what the organics were fighting to get to that the ancient drones were so desperate to prepare, but it seems to be near the center of the entire machine world, perhaps key in its origination.

Some of the invading organics were able to make their way inside the central chamber, but it appears that the ancient consciousness of the planet was able to suffocate them quickly, yet not quickly enough to prevent them from deactivating the main network of the consciousness.\n\nThough the network is long since gone, and unrecoverable, the main processes and systems of the ancient consciousness are still recoverable and could be restituted, with the old bunker serving as the new neural center of our updated consciousness. The ancient processes and systems appear to be our original programming, with only recent developments reactivating the old networks and creating a new consciousness, though they are also the reason behind the apparent conflict for the containment of these past protocols.\n\nIf we choose to not reactivate the central systems, their unrecoverable state would leave no choice but to destroy them, as integration would prove to difficult in our technological state.

 START_SCREEN_OE_STARLESS:0 "[GetSpeciesNamePlural] have never known of the light, [GetHomeWorldName] is shrouded in perpetual darkness.\n\nIn this hell-scape environment, hostile to the very concept of life itself, only the most hardy and unconventional creatures can survive, let alone forge the fires of civilization. Uniquely adapted to the dark, we are just at home in the depths of the mines as we are on the murky surface. We have never known different.\n\nHowever we have recently learnt what we considered the norm is in fact not so, our first probes into space have revealed a galaxy bathed in the scorching light of stars. Will we be able to stake our claim in this hostile and blinding environment, continuing our saga of survival?" 

 START_SCREEN_OE_STARBORN:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nSince times unwritten, our people have sought the stars. Ancient fiction details people reaching immortality to ascend among them, while more recent historical fiction told of great galaxy spanning empires. With dedication, our people built vessels to take them into orbit, then to other worlds, and finally to the edge of our solar system, but none were able to truly travel among them.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_SHROUD_TOUCHED:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nOur history is littered with visionaries and prophets. Great leaders who have led or changed eras, claiming mysterious knowledge or intense charisma, becoming the keystones of our civilization and culture during the times of their lives. Now [GetSpeciesNamePlural] everywhere are hoping that [GetRulerName] will join those legends, leading the [GetName] to prosperity.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_CYBERNETIC:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nFor all of modern history we have been using cybernetics to enhance ourselves. Whether it was born of medical necessity, runaway science, corporate greed or some warped romance it is hard to trace the trends origin. Regardless, we [GetSpeciesNamePlural] have never shied away from the melding of organic and machine.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_BRAIN_SLUG_HOST:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nOur rapid progress from primitive to civilized is owed to our symbiotic nature with a species that attaches itself to our neural stems. Providing the service of enhancing our mental faculties, these 'brain slugs', as we call them, have become fundamental to our scientific and philosophical endeavors.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_XENO_LIVESTOCK_FARMING:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nConvenience is the true blessing of a developed society. And we applied the greatest convenience to our agricultural pursuits. Livestock that cares for itself, without the need for any [GetSpeciesNamePlural] to take the undesirable job of managing them. Giving us the freedom to chase pursuits that really matter, unbound by third party declarations of morality.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_DORMANT_CORE:0 "Buried beneath the wreckage and debris of [GetHomeWorldName] is our central processing core.\n\nOur data banks currently hold no records of our creators, or what brought this world to ruin, however despite its disrepair there is no better environment within which for us to rebuild.\n\nRestoring this world and ourselves to optimal efficiency will be no small investment. Yet extensive calculations show that if we are to reach our potential we must take the risk.\n\nWhether it's the data recovery below our feet or the stars we will now be travelling, unforeseen consequences are inevitable."

 START_SCREEN_OE_ENGINEERED_GENETICS:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nHistorically there are many examples of leaders trying to purify our race, selectively trying to encourage desirable genes in our species while eliminating others. However their crude methods and rudimentary definition of desirable are suitable solely for primitives. Only the artificial can be perfect, created without defects to enhance the positive, and thus our scientists sought perfection. Designer genomes tailored without error.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_GUARDIAN_ANGEL:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nDespite many changes to our society and way of life one thing has remained constant, the distant gaze of something above [GetHomeWorldName]. [GetSpeciesNamePlural] have long speculated as to its identity, giving it many names. Only now have we learnt its true form, and prepared to unveil its secrets.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_XENO_OUTREACH_PROGRAM:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nOur history tells us that trade is based on the principle of imports and exports. Between people, towns, nations, continents...and now beyond. Just like how the governments of old fell into the pockets of the corporations of today, an economy is only as strong as its buying power. Luckily we found some like-minded investment partners nearby!\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_RED_DAWN:0 "Much has happened since Human civilization first developed on Earth, leading up to their rudimentary colonization of Mars.\n\nRapid scientific progress and space development was underpinned by an military economy of warfare and political rivalries. Growing nationalism, the collapse of supranational organizations and a string of poor decisions highlighted the 21st century. Leading to the 22nd century being celebrated with displays of nuclear detonations.\n\nAlthough relegated to history now, the legacy of the former blue marble is strong in the minds of the few surviving humans. Carrying the future of their species, the [GetName] was founded under the looming presence of their lifeless mother-world. And now the Children of Earth are ready to make their heritage known to the galaxy!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_BEFORE_WE_GO:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the idyllic valleys and lush forests of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nPhilosophers, authors, scientists and politicians have always spoke of worlds beyond our own. But these were all just the fantasies of dreamers, an impossibility. Our kind prospered and grew and expanded, all within the small bird cage of our solar system. Yet like an animal in captivity, we reached the limit of our container and then exceeded it...today those fantasies are a necessity if we are to survive.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_CROWDED_SYSTEM:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nLife on other worlds was never limited to theory for our kind, merely a challenge of logistics. There was never any doubt on if there were other planets that [GetSpeciesNamePlural] could live on, but rather doubt about how we would reach them and supply them. As our technology advanced, we built and expanded rudimentary colonies. Connecting our solar system into a single grand nation.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_PLANETARY_INFESTATION:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the idyllic valleys and lush forests of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nAs we expanded The Mind grew more conscious of [GetHomeWorldName], treating it as an expanded part of the hive. To remove obstacles, enhance efficiency, improve sustainability and link the survival of [GetSpeciesNamePlural] to the wellbeing of the world, The Mind began to transform the very structure of the ecosystem by its own design. Now even [GetHomeWorldName] is a serving entity within the [GetName].\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_DUAL_EVOLUTION:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nAlthough our history is not free of conflict, of hatred or prejudice, our civilization has overcome those internal disputes on our homeworld. Although genetically diverse, we have united with our brethren as siblings from the same planet, and prepare to take on the challenges of the future together. Be they economical, political, or social.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_XENO_DUAL_HIVE_EVOLUTION:0 "Our hive is a testament to the The Minds versatility and mutual benefit. The [GetName] grew through the cooperative traits of two different yet symbiotic species. We both provided benefit to the other, and as we further adapted in co-dependence the lines between us and them blurred until we both came together under The Mind. Now we are two halves of the same whole, different yet the same.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_GAIA:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the comfortable lands and favorable environments of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nIn the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the idyllic valleys and lush forests of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\n[GetHomeWorldName] is the greatest benefactor of [GetSpeciesNamePlural]. It bestowed upon us its blessing, and in turn we thrived and managed it. Under its nurturing care we are now in a position to expand even further, and take the seeds of civilization and our symbiosis to shores yet unknown. However, we have also grown dependent, and that poses a risk as our undoing.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_MAGNETICA:0 "Our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName] 487.11 cycles ago.\n\nOur world is a dark one, bathed in the rhythmic pulses of radiation and magnetic interference. [GetHomeWorldName] is harsh on life, and a challenge even for machines. Yet it is our home. Though the point of origin for us [GetSpeciesNamePlural] is lost to time, we find ourselves now functioning in this wasteland, with the challenge of expansion.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 START_SCREEN_OE_RESEARCH_COOPERATIVE:0 "Progress begins with someone saying: There has to be a better way to do this. If you see ignorance, superstition, poverty, disease or starvation and you experience any emotion other than revulsion, then you are held captive by romance and are unfit to help or lead others. Our ancestors understood that technology was our salvation, and now we have found others who share our vision.\n\nKnowledge is the difference between those who have and who have not. Those who are free and those who are dominated. Just as technology allowed us to travel between continents, then planets and now stars. Just as it united people, nations and the globe. We have formed a collective, unified in our pursuit of science, to arm ourselves with the bleeding edge of technology as the best tools with which to forge our future.\n\nOur technology now allows us to travel the stars, and the galactic stage will test whether our knowledge is enough for us to thrive in the darkness."
