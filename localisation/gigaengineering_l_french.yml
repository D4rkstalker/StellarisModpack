It therefore becomes necessary to make use of constructs rooted within higher dimensions in order to stabilize these colossal gigastructures. This paves the way for many innovative technologies, such as the ability to fit more matter in a given volume without it collapsing into a black hole, and to be able to defy gravity on unimaginable scales.

Its frame is mostly made out of Quberine, an extremely advanced alloy packed with incredibly complex self-repairing electronics, thus explaining how it is able to withstand the incredible forces exerted on it.\n\nOur scientists believe it might be possible to repair this thing, given enough resources and sufficiently advanced technologies. We have detected a number of deactivated Quberine-manufacturing plants within the ringworld, which might start producing Quberine again if we restore this ringworld's power supply during future repairs.\n\nThe research teams have also concluded that the small station above the star serves as a sort of "central access point" to the Squareworld's internal systems. They encourage us to spend some energy credits and alloys to repair and subsequently re-activate it, as it might grant us to access invaluable data about the Squareworld and its builders stored within its vast internal archives.

It's been a while since I've talked to a sapient entity.\n\nI am Garyx, the artificial intelligence responsible for maintaining the Squareworld and its vast data archives, and I have taken the form of a holographic reptilian, as this is what my makers looked like.\n\nAnyways, apologies for the sorry state of the Squareworld. I found a particularly interesting documentary about reptilian reproduction, and I've been studying it for the past 120 millenia using backup power in order to better understand my makers. Unfortunately, it seems that something drastic happened to the Squareworld in the meantime...Oh well.\n\nNow that you're here, and since my makers are apparently long gone, you can have permission to access the Squareworld's databanks, which are surprisingly mostly intact."
 
 gigagaryx.1.a:0 "What's in those databanks?"
 gigagaryx.1.a.response:0 "Oh, many things. My makers stored plenty of data about the various empires and species they knew about, their scientific knowledge, and most importantly, their deity §BQubey§!.\nThey wanted to preserve it so future generations could benefit from it, and, well, since you're here now, I guess they succeeded in this task. Too bad they're not here to see it anymore..."

 gigagaryx.1.b.response:0 "Well, judging from the position of the stars, I estimate that this thing's been broken for about 120 000 of your years, but it is much older than that.\nIt was built about 567 000 years ago by my makers, and housed their civilization for many millenia. I'm not sure what happened to it, as I was unfortunately completely captivated by my research. The most likely possibility is that their civilization collapsed from decadence or simply grew too old and divergent, just like many other great empires before them."
 
 gigagaryx.1.c:0 "Who built the Squareworld, and why?"
 gigagaryx.1.c.response:0 "My makers did. They were a species of §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, known as the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, and they ruled over a rather large empire, the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!\n\nThey were incredibly religious too, and worshipped a deity they called §BQubey§!. This deity was said to have helped their species evolve over million of years, and many saw the perfection of geometrical shapes as §BQubey§!'s way to manifest his presence to the world.\n\nMy makers eventually discovered an incredible substance, possessing unrivaled self-repairing properties. They dubbed it "Quberine", as they believed the substance was made out of §BQubey§! himself, and decided to use it to construct this magnificient physics-defying geometrical structure as a way to both worship and show their gratitude towards §BQubey§!\n\nThey also took the opportunity to pack as much data about their scientific advancements, Quberine, the Squareworld, and §BQubey§!, into the databanks, in hopes that a future civilization stumbling upon it may learn of the almighty §BQubey§! as well."
  
 gigagaryx.1.d:0 "Can we somehow repair the Squareworld?"
 gigagaryx.1.d.response:0 "Hopefully yes! The mostly-functional archives contain a lot of data about the Squareworld's internal and external structure. If you give me a few dozen months to compile it all, I can give your scientists a data cache containing all the necessary information to conduct extensive repairs on the megastructure. I'd love to see the Squareworld restored to its former glory!"
