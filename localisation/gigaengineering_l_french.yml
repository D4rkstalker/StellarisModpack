We have detected a number of deactivated Quberine-manufacturing plants within the ringworld, which might start producing Quberine again if we restore this ringworld's power supply during future repairs.\n\nThe research teams have also concluded that the small station above the star serves as a sort of "central access point" to the Squareworld's internal systems. They encourage us to spend some energy credits and alloys to repair and subsequently re-activate it, as it might grant us to access invaluable data about the Squareworld and its builders stored within its vast internal archives.

I found a particularly interesting documentary about reptilian reproduction, and I've been studying it for the past 120 millenia using backup power in order to better understand my makers. Unfortunately, it seems that something drastic happened to the Squareworld in the meantime...Oh well.\n\nNow that you're here, and since my makers are apparently long gone, you can have permission to access the Squareworld's databanks, which are surprisingly mostly intact."
 
 gigagaryx.1.a:0 "What's in those databanks?"

 gigagaryx.1.b.response:0 "Well, judging from the position of the stars, I estimate that this thing's been broken for about 120 000 of your years, but it is much older than that.\nIt was built about 567 000 years ago by my makers, and housed their civilization for many millenia. I'm not sure what happened to it, as I was unfortunately completely captivated by my research. The most likely possibility is that their civilization collapsed from decadence or simply grew too old and divergent, just like many other great empires before them."
 
 gigagaryx.1.c:0 "Who built the Squareworld, and why?"
 gigagaryx.1.c.response:0 "My makers did. They were a species of §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, known as the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, and they ruled over a rather large empire, the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!\n\nThey were incredibly religious too, and worshipped a deity they called §BQubey§!. This deity was said to have helped their species evolve over million of years, and many saw the perfection of geometrical shapes as §BQubey§!'s way to manifest his presence to the world.\n\nMy makers eventually discovered an incredible substance, possessing unrivaled self-repairing properties. They dubbed it "Quberine", as they believed the substance was made out of §BQubey§! himself, and decided to use it to construct this magnificient physics-defying geometrical structure as a way to both worship and show their gratitude towards §BQubey§!\n\nThey also took the opportunity to pack as much data about their scientific advancements, Quberine, the Squareworld, and §BQubey§!, into the databanks, in hopes that a future civilization stumbling upon it may learn of the almighty §BQubey§! as well."
  
 gigagaryx.1.d:0 "Can we somehow repair the Squareworld?"

Millenia ago, three major superpowers pooled their knowledge to try and develop an experimental device capable of seeding life onto any rocky planet, no matter how hostile or desolate. And, by all accounts, they succeeded, as shown by the current state of the Withdrawal system.\n\nThe final goal of this project was to create a perfect haven for everyone to live in, and so these superpowers preparing the system for future habitation. It appears that the automated robotic units tasked with setting up infrastructure on the planet encountered no issues, but a few years after sapient life settled on the planets, all hell broke loose. The planets' ecosystems were resilient. Incredibly resilient. So resilient in fact, that fauna and flora began attacking the unsuspecting colonists, collapsing buildings and swallowing cities. It seems that the "Staff of Life" was too efficient, rendering the planets uninhabitable to sapient life. Unfortunately, the project exhausted the superpowers' economy, as they had not anticipated a failure, causing their decline and eventual collapse.\n\nEach superpower seems to have contributed to about one third of this "Staff of Life". Our scientists believe that if we can somehow manage to locate these empires' home systems, we might be able to reconstitute the "Staff of Life" for ourselves."

It gets lonely quickly, you know? And no, those weird furry things you probably saw while coming here don't count. They're mindless drones I bioengineered to do things I didn't want to do myself. They don't have much conversation, sadly.\n\nFor the past few centuries, I've been working down here, doing experiments, creating fancy technologies. But I believe my research is finally coming to a close. You see, I've been trying to figure out a way to travel through the spacetime continuum in both directions...In other words, time travel. Yeah."
 pouchkinn.7.a:0 "Time travel?"
 pouchkinn.7.a.response:0 "Yes, time travel. I'm fairly certain I'm reaaallyyy close to figuring it out. Or am I? I...I don't even know anymore. It's been so long. It's just an endless stream of equations and experiments and more equations and theories...I've generated miniature wormholes, punched holes through spacetime, and messed with Tachyons, and yet it still eludes me."
 pouchkinn.7.b:0 "Did you build this Orbital Elysium?"
 pouchkinn.7.b.response:0 "What? No of course. I just...found it. It was there, just laying around orbiting a gas giant. So I settled it. There weren't any empires around when I arrived here.\n\nIn fact, your species is listed as "Not FTL-capable" in my database. Guess I should update it more often, huh?"
 pouchkinn.7.c:0 "Are you the one behind the ships and the drones?"
 pouchkinn.7.c.response:0 "Oh. Those. Yeah. I built them a whiiiile back. Well, I didn't really "build" the ships. I scavenged them from across the galaxy.\n\nRandom ships crashed in asteroid fields, or abandonned freighters. Gave 'em a little fixer upper and they were good to go. Put 'em near the Elysium to make sure nobody would bother me. Guess they failed, uh? After all, I designed them to ward off space fauna and pirates. Didn't expect a full-on assault by a space empire.\n\nSame thing with those drones. Quite proud of 'em. Lots of engineering inside. Oh, did the drones almost murder your colonists? Sorry about that."
 pouchkinn.7.d:0 "How long have you been down there?"
 pouchkinn.7.d.response:0 "A very, very long time. At least a few centuries. I've been busy doing "science" ever since. I like it here, it's very quiet. Perfect place to conduct my experiments without some annoying government screaming that it's "too dangerous".
