mzilli_star_crisis_events.2.desc.a:0 "After intense analysis, [Root.Leader.GetName] has determined the cause of §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§!'s rapid aging. There seems to be a buildup of dark energy within its core, which is disrupting the convection of its interior and thus starving it of hydrogen it would normally fuse for fuel. How this dark energy got there is still unknown.\n\nOminously, the rate of the star's aging seems to be increasing exponentially. [Root.Leader.GetName] has calculated that on §R[FROMFROM.supernova_date]§!, it will explode in a supernova and destroy everything in the [FromFrom.System.GetName] system."

Regardless, the star's destiny is now complete, and we can put this matter behind us."
mzilli_star_crisis_events.6.desc.b:0 "The giant star §H[From.GetName]§! has apparently gone supernova, as observed by our subspace telescopes.
