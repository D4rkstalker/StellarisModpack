 START_SCREEN_COMMON_GROUND_same_species:0 "Decades ago, our sublight probes returned from the long forgotten colonisation efforts, finding 2 distinct cultures of our race thriving in those systems. Despite the differences in culture centuries can bring, it quickly became apparent that we had more things in common than not, finding solidarity in both our differences and our similarities. Like us, they were also on the cusp of unlocking practical interstellar travel.\n\nA bond was formed between our three civilizations, which eventually led to the birth of a federation - we would combine our efforts, and when we were ready to spread out into the cosmos, whatever was out there would be faced by us standing together."

Like us, they were on the verge of developing practical interstellar travel, but their governments were weak and disorganized.\n\nRecognizing that their strength would add to our own, we began to gradually push for a political union under our supervision that would unite our three civilizations. There was resistance at first, but eventually the benefits of sharing in our leadership and ambition became too obvious for even them to ignore. A new order had been established."
