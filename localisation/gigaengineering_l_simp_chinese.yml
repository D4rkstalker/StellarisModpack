This deity was said to have helped their species evolve over million of years, and many saw the perfection of geometrical shapes as §BQubey§!'s way to manifest his presence to the world.\n\nMy makers eventually discovered an incredible substance, possessing unrivaled self-repairing properties. They dubbed it 'Quberine', as they believed the substance was made out of §BQubey§! himself, and decided to use it to construct this magnificent physics-defying geometrical structure as a way to both worship and show their gratitude towards §BQubey§!\n\nThey also took the opportunity to pack as much data about their scientific advancements, Quberine, the Squareworld, and §BQubey§!, into the databanks, in hopes that a future civilization stumbling upon it may learn of the almighty §BQubey§! as well."

We are going to need to explore the planet a bit more if we want to truly find out the reasons for this war.\n\nAs for Jeimza herself, we could recruit her as a fleet admiral, or we could euthanize and dissect her to learn more about Ezicanian biology..."

They eventually found a massive, mostly collapsed room, with a throne on which a somewhat short Katzen skeleton sat, clutching a small device within one of its hands.\n\nAlthough initially confused, they found out that the skeleton was none other than Meopa himself! Several data caches were scattered throughout the room, presumably logging devices used by Meopa to record his actions. The devices are ancient and damaged. It will take immense effort to properly decrypt and analyze them.\n\nThey also located several valuable gemstones, which would fetch quite a good price on the market."

But, after a lot of scavenging, we have finally found out about the horrifying truth...\n\nMeopa did indeed start Projekt Katzenform, which aimed to transform Potradus into a habitable world. However, the Katzens only possessed limited FTL, and very few colonies outside their home system, which made the project tremendously expensive to their civilization. Although the terraforming structure was remarkably well-made, its sheer cost led to an economic collapse. Because of this, the Daggos of Nienet, a civilization which shared the Gatzo system and were once close allies to the Katzens, decided to strike at Katzenland, in an attempt to conquer it while it was weakened, contradicting our original theory that the Katzens struck first.\n\nMeopa then retaliated with the 'fury of a thousand suns', completely and utterly devastating Nienet's surface. This disproportionate genocidal response led to a drastic drop in the nation's stability, which culminated with empire-wide revolts against Meopa's regime. Meopa, unwilling to step down, and his sanity rapidly deteriorating, proceeded to do the unthinkable:\nHe unleashed the rest of Katzen nuclear arsenal...upon Katzenland itself. He destroyed his own world, killing billions of Katzens and Ezicania. The relatively small Katzen space empire then collapsed, with the few colonies unable to sustain themselves without their capital.\n\nAlthough, the records spoke of a large colonization vessel labelled the 'Meopian Expedition 1', launched prior to the Daggo-Katzen war towards an unknown faraway planet, which carried both Katzens and Ezicanias in cryosleep, meaning there is a slim chance the species are still out there, somewhere.\n\nOn the bright side, we have managed to recover surprisingly intact and detailed schematics of Projekt Katzenform, which will undoubtedly benefit our knowledge of terraforming."

	giga_birch.300.desc:0 "After an arduous journey, our science ship has finally reached the center of our galaxy.\nUpon entering the system, the crew was stunned by the sight of an absolutely massive §YActive Supermassive Quasar§!, or Hyperquasar.\n\nThis gargantuan object weighs several hundred millions stellar masses, and has a diameter of several hundreds astronomical units.\nAlthough it is mere speculation for now, some of the wildest elements in the scientific community theorize that it would be possible to construct a gigantic hyperweapon around this quasar, which would harness its cataclysmic energies to unleash a beam capable of untold destructive power."

	gigaquasar.110.desc:0 "It was already over for the machine world the moment the $name_quasistellar$'s wormhole appeared overhead. Shortly afterwards, a gargantuan flow of energy, equivalent to the galaxy's entire energy output, blasted from the wormhole. It only took the beam mere seconds to utterly obliterate the planet.\n\nThere is nothing left of the former robotic world, and the Ghost Signal has been severely weakened as a result."

	gigaquasar.112.desc:0 "The Contingency has failed. With the destruction of the last Machine World, the galaxy no longer faces the threat of systematic mass extinction, from the Contingency, at least. All surviving Contingency warforms have either powered down or self-destructed, and the Ghost Signal is no longer being transmitted.\n\nThe main nexus was utterly obliterated in mere seconds by the $name_quasistellar$'s immensely powerful laser, leaving nothing behind.\n\nAlthough the Contingency is no more, whether or not the [quasistellar_owner.GetName] will aim their hyperweapon at other targets remains to be seen..."
