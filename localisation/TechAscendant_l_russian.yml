 materials_discovered.desc: "Our scientists are buzzing with envy at the reports coming out of [materials_origin.capital_scope.GetName]. Advances in nanotechnology have long been the key to producing new materials for a myriad of applications, but industrial construction at the nano scale is something we thought was simply out of reach. The implications for engineering and materials technology are astounding. Unless we wish to quickly become a technological backwater, we should do our best to secure either a research agreement or acquire a disaffected [materials_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist asset through espionage. \n\n[materials_origin.GetName]:\n§M$materials_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$materials.effect$"

 industry_discovered.desc: "Apparently, researchers on [industry_origin.capital_scope.GetName] have managed to engineer some kind of rapidly growing organic mineral. It may seem like a contradiction, but the implications for engineering and industrial technology are quite literally groundbreaking. If we wish to remain on the cutting edge of science, we should either form a research pact or find a malleable [industry_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist to steal a sample. \n\n[industry_origin.GetName]:\n§M$industry_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$industry.effect$"

 voidcraft_discovered.desc: "The Ships of [voidcraft_origin.capital_scope.GetName] are Alive! Our engineers react to this stunning breakthrough with a mixture of revulsion and fascination, with wild speculation on the greater implications of organic vessels for ship design. While there is no consensus yet on whether we should attempt to replicate this feat, the most glaring fact is that it puts us firmly behind in engineering technology. We should do our best to secure either a research agreement or find a [voidcraft_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist with a loose tongue. \n\n[voidcraft_origin.GetName]:\n§M$voidcraft_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$voidcraft.effect$"

 rocketry_discovered.desc: "Somehow, [rocketry_origin.capital_scope.GetName] has managed to escape Newtons Laws. A leaked report on the so called inertialess drive defies our understanding of propulsion systems. But if the technical specs are to be believed, our engineers will be playing catchup for years to come. It would be prudent to propose research agreement or covertly acquire a [rocketry_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist so that our ships too can be spared the tyranny of equal and opposite reactions. \n\n[rocketry_origin.GetName]:\n§M$rocketry_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$rocketry.effect$"

 particles_discovered.desc: "The Science Directorate is simply stunned with the latest news from [particles_origin.capital_scope.GetName]. If the results they claim can be confirmed, it could change our fundamental understanding of quantum physics. In these uncertain times, perhaps we should secure a research agreement or acquire a disaffected [particles_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist who may be able to explain this radical theory if provided with the proper leverage. \n\n[particles_origin.GetName]:\n§M$particles_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$particles.effect$"

 field_manipulation_discovered.desc: "Researchers from [field_manipulation_origin.capital_scope.GetName] have done the impossible, they claim to be able to manipulate time itself. While the academy assures us that time travel remains the stuff of science fiction, these so called temporal fields do fundamentally alter our understanding of physics. Time is against us if we wish to remain on par in technology, we should do our best to form a research agreement or acquire the help of a [field_manipulation_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist through less reputable means. \n\n[field_manipulation_origin.GetName]:\n§M$field_manipulation_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$field_manipulation.effect$"

 computing_discovered.desc: "The Singularity is upon us! A terrifying super intelligence has been unleashed on [computing_origin.capital_scope.GetName], yet somehow, it appears to be contained- at least for now. What this marvel of programing and circuitry can achieve is nothing short of revolutionary, and let us hope that assement remains figurative. We should do our best to secure either a research agreement or pressure a [computing_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist to steal a copy of the source code. \n\n[computing_origin.GetName]:\n§M$computing_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$computing.effect$"

 psionics_discovered.desc: "Strange tidings from [psionics_origin.capital_scope.GetName], where an eccentric mathematician claims to be able to predict the future with complex equations and statistics. Usually, such claims would be dismissed as junk science, but this has a level of intellectual rigor that is backed up by a perfect prediction record. This could change our basic understanding of society itself, and the entire academy is desperate to understand what exactly this discovery means. Unless we wish to slide back into the technological dark ages, we should do our best to secure either a research agreement or acquire a disgruntled [psionics_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist asset through espionage. \n\n[psionics_origin.GetName]:\n§M$psionics_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$psionics.effect$"

 statecraft_discovered.desc: "Linguists from across the galaxy are flocking to [statecraft_origin.capital_scope.GetName], where the first working Universal Translation device has been revealed. Society and interstellar diplomacy as we know it will likely never be the same. The Diplomatic Corps has made entreaties for us to make a research agreement to discover this technology, while intelligence services are formulating plans to acquire a disaffected [statecraft_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist asset to speed the process a long. \n\n[statecraft_origin.GetName]:\n§M$statecraft_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$statecraft.effect$"

 biology_discovered.desc: "[biology_origin.capital_scope.GetName] is now a shining beacon of medical science. Real time editing of living cells grants absolute control of the building blocks of life, this genetic breakthrough will rewrite the entire field biology. 9 out of 10 doctors reccommend that we form a research agreement or find a [biology_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist willing to share the secrets of life. \n\n[biology_origin.GetName]:\n§M$biology_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$biology.effect$"

 new_worlds_discovered.desc: "Boldly going where few have gone before, [new_worlds_origin.capital_scope.GetName] has set out on a mission to explore strange new worlds. Valuable insights into the nature of life and society are sure to follow. Unless we wish to fall behind, we should consider forming a research agreement or infiltrating into the [new_worlds_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] science academy. \n\n[new_worlds_origin.GetName]:\n§M$new_worlds_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$new_worlds.effect$"

 military_theory_discovered.desc: "The Admiralty is nearly boiling over with jealousy at the reports from [military_theory_origin.capital_scope.GetName]. The tactical and strategic planning coming from these so-called Grand Strategy games are serious indeed. It could change the fundamental doctrines on military theory. Unless we wish to quickly become outpaced by the newest meta, we should do our best to sign a research agreement or secure a pliable [military_theory_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] science asset. \n\n[military_theory_origin.GetName]:\n§M$military_theory_breakthrough.title$ §! \n$military_theory.effect$"

 
 breakthrough.materials.desc: "Nanofabrication has long been a dream of our scientists, but today Chief Engineer §Y[engineering_researcher.GetName]§! has laid out a credible plan to make it a reality. In a widely publicized speech at the academy, [engineering_researcher.GetName] said: We tell our children that there is no dream too big, but the truth is we have not been thinking small enough! The ability to construct molecules from the ground up, the chance to play with the very building blocks of the universe as if they were Legos, opens entirely new fields for materials technology. The admiralty believes this knowledge would allow for nearly impenetrable hull plating, and it is certain to revolutionize nearly all fields of engineering."
 breakthrough.industry.desc: "Silicon lifeforms were once a trope of early [root.GetSpeciesName] science fiction, with novels and television episodes depicting indecipherable rock-like aliens. Today, §Y[engineering_researcher.GetName]§!, head of Engineering claims to be able to create silicon based life in the flesh... if you can call it flesh. These creatures are essentially living, growing minerals. Instead of mining deep underground for metals and crystals, the raw materials of advanced society can simply be grown. The engineering applications of living minerals are staggering. Some claim it is to be start of a 12th industrial revolution, while others claim that this is the logical conclusion of a long history of resource exploitation, what better end could there be than to find out how to give life to and then exploit the resources themselves. And yes, now you really can have a pet rock."
 breakthrough.rocketry.desc: "The biggest limitation of sub-light space travel is not our thrust technology, but our own biology. Ships can handle far greater G-forces than the squishy beings inside them. Chief Engineer §Y[engineering_researcher.GetName]§! has a theory that a small targeted hyperspace field directly between our engines and the rest of the ship can absorb inertia, effectively reducing any amount of external acceleration to a tolerable interior G force. Apparently there is a small chance that bits of the ship and crew could also leak into hyperspace, but that is a minor price to pay for this kind speed. The test crew did return with 98% of their limbs, which is within the margin of error. This technology will surely revolutionize ship design and have far reaching applications in engineering."
 breakthrough.particles.desc: "The uncertainty principle has long fascinated amateur [root.GetSpeciesName] science enthusiasts, who have often misused it to make absurd claims about small furry animals in boxes. Our Head Physicist, §Y[physics_researcher.GetName]§! believes that while you may not be able to know an objects speed and position, you could just guess. Predictive quantum mechanics could completely reshape our understanding of particle physics, with the first of many applications in increasing the output of fusion reactors. A lab assistant explained the breakthrough this way: Imagine you have a blorg in a box. You don't know if the blorg is alive or dead, so until you look in the box it is in a state of quantum superposition, the blorg is both alive and dead. But, if we know the blorg is alive, we can guess with near certainty that the blorg wants friends. That is basically how predictive quantum mechanics works."
 breakthrough.voidcraft.desc: "Captains have spoken about their ships as if they were living beings since our ancestors were traveling in wooden ships powered by the wind. Today, old superstitions are a reality as our Head of Engineering §Y[engineering_researcher.GetName]§! has developed a prototype of organic starships. Made out of a combination of metal and tissue, held together by synaptic circuits, these living voidcraft can sense their surroundings, avoid danger, and heal themselves from superficial injuries. They have hopes and dreams, and make their home among the stars. What new wonders in engineering will these incredible ships bring to our universe?"
 breakthrough.field_manipulation.desc: "Shields have always functioned to mitigate damage by placing either a physical or energy based barrier between the attacked and the attacker. However, a head scientist §Y[physics_researcher.GetName]§! may have found a way to place that barrier not in space, but in time. While true time travel remains out of reach, temporal shielding uses small scale time displacement fields to offset incoming ordinance by a few seconds, preventing it from hitting what it was aimed at. Sadly, time displacement fields are only stable for extremely short periods, so going back in time to tell yourself to make better life choices or what the winning lottery numbers will be remains the stuff of science fiction. Nonetheless, the applications of this technology for physics research are astounding."
 breakthrough.computing.desc: "The fear that a creation will surpass the capabilities of its creator has been fodder for literature on our world since before we even knew about computing. To this day old stories of monsters being assembled out of parts of the dead or some such nonsense still inspire a cult-like following. However, §Y[physics_researcher.GetName]§!, Head of the Science Academy claims to have finally done it! A self improving intelligence has rapidly made our brightest minds seem like ants in comparison to this new technological singularity. Conveniently, researchers also put that super-intelligence inside an unstable hyperspace field which they can shut down at any moment. Critics say such an all powerful being cannot be contained forever, and that eventually the intelligence will simply talk the scientists into releasing it. But such an idea is absurd, why would anyone in their right mind let a likely angry and malevolent super-intelligence out of its box? Until the day it escapes, our researchers believe we could rapidly expand our knowledge of physics and organization by learning from the being."
 breakthrough.psionics.desc: "Predicting the future has long been relegated to the fringes of our society, with soothsayers and fortune tellers merely telling tales that their audience already wants to hear. However, while the future of an individual is chaotic and unpredictable, the behavior of large groups, planets, and entire empires is quite knowable, just as the path of a single molecule in a gas is chaos, we can nonetheless predict the behavior the gas as a group as it fills a container despite knowing little about the individual molecules within. Sociologist §Y[society_researcher.GetName]§! has shown that through a combination of statistics, psychology, and history they can apply this to the galaxy at large, and the larger the group, the more accurate the future they can predict. Their newfound uncanny ability to predict the future could lead to advances in all fields, and unifying our people as never before. Perhaps this is all a great act however, a few deranged individuals have broken free and claimed that they foresee impending doom for the entire galaxy. They have started some sort of 'Foundation' to preserve knowledge through a thousand years of darkness. They are clearly lunatics to be ignored."
 breakthrough.new_worlds.desc: "New colonies were once a wild lawless land, full of foolhardy but well meaning characters and a sense of adventure. While a romantic notion popular in books and holovids, this was never a highly efficient system for spreading to new worlds. Administrator §Y[society_researcher.GetName]§! has streamlined colony protocols and tamed the frontier with the stroke of a pen and some orderly ordinances. New [root.GetSpeciesName] colonies will develop at a faster rate and secure larger, self sufficient populations with ease. Each new colony can be seen as an incubator for new social structures, a vast social experiment that could revolutionize our society."
 breakthrough.biology.desc: "Genetics manipulation was once considered an ethical dilemma by early [root.GetSpeciesName] society. It would be too easy to create a permanent underclass of the genetically inferior, and conflict with genetically enhanced super-[root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] was a common trope of period science fiction. However, Surgeon General §Y[society_researcher.GetName]§! claims to have discovered a way to make instant edits directly to living subjects, revolutionizing genetics, biology, and their society at large. Now evolution does not have to wait for generations to have an effect, and societal stratification is a not a concern as anyone anytime could alter their genome as they see fit. Somehow, this is not exactly a comforting thought."
 breakthrough.statecraft.desc: "In early [root.GetSpeciesAdj] science fiction, universal translators were little more than a plot device, language barriers were inconvenient to the flow of most 30 minute episodes. Yet today, Linguist §Y[society_researcher.GetName]§! has developed a real life portable device that can allow natural communication between anyone. With the idealistic belief that simple communication could be the last, best hope for peace, [root.GetName] has built a station in neutral territory to prevent future wars, a place where [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. Its a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. The name of the place is Babylon 5. Perhaps we should send an ambassador."
 breakthrough.military_theory.desc: "The lessons of history are the keys to the future. It seems that many academics, including the esteemed §Y[society_researcher.GetName]§!, have become obsessed with a series of grand strategy games that depict various time periods from their history. Some cover the great wars of their past, the struggles of feudal lords to gain power when [military_theory_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were still a primitive race, or more recent events like exploration and expansion into space. Perhaps this fascination with history and strategy will cultivated a crop of leaders far better equipped to understand complex situations and deal with tactics and logistics to lead large fleets into battle."

The masses will believe anything that offers them hope, and for now letting them flock to the teachings of a few self indulgent statisticians and sociologists is helpful to the stability government.

They take their task with an almost religious zeal, and guard their secrets jealously. So far they have refused our agents access to their vaults, and refuse to recognize proper authorities.
