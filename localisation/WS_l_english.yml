  sc_dn:0 "§HWild Space!"
  sc_dn_desc:0 "§L"Space is vast. Much of it is empty. All of it is dangerous. This "wild space" is not so much a system as a confluence point; a gravitational anomaly from which it would be advisable to move on quickly. It can never be colonised."§!"
  pc_dn_star:0 "Wild Space"
  pc_dn_star_desc:0 "Space is vast. Much of it is empty. All of it is dangerous. This "wild space" is not so much a system as a confluence point; a gravitational anomaly from which it would be advisable to move on quickly. It can never be colonised."
  pc_WS_barycenter:0 "Barycenter"
  pc_WS_barycenter_desc:1 "This is not an actual object; rather, it is an imaginary point that two binary objects orbit."
  
####TECHNOLOGIES#########
 tech_WS_gateways: "Advanced Gateway Construction"
 tech_WS_gateways_desc: "Extensive experimentation and analysis of the gravitational peculiarities of unstable hyperlanes in Wild Space has enhanced our understanding of the Gateway network. We can now build modified Gateways in unclaimed Wild Space."

######## MEGASTRUCTURES ##### 

   WS_gateway_0_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS:1 "A portal through subspace that allows instantaneous travel to other Gateways."
   WS_gateway_0:0 "Gateway Construction Site"
   WS_gateway_0_DESC:0 "The initial site will serve as the base for the construction of a future Gateway."
   WS_gateway_final:0 "Gateway"
   WS_gateway_final_DESC:0 "A conduit through the very fabric of subspace that enables rapid travel to other Gateways."
   WS_gateway_final_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS:0 "Cannot build a Gateway too far beyond the gravity well of a system"

  WS_anchor_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS:1 "An artificial gravitational anomaly being used to stabalise the hyperlanes in this sector."
   WS_anchor:0 "Hyperlane Anchor"
   WS_anchor_DESC:0 "An artificial gravitational anomaly being used to stabalise the hyperlanes in this sector."

 ######## REQUIREMENTS ######
   requires_wild_space:1 "This can only be built within Wild Space systems."
