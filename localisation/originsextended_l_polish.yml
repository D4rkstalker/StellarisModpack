 starless.200.a:0 "Most peculiar."

 starless.201.name:0 "In Great Haste"
 starless.201.desc:0 "At first glance, it appears that the remaining structures of §Y[starless_shattered.GetName]§!'s larger chunks are indeed the remains of long-abandoned colonial settlements, apparently quickly abandoned, for no clear reason.\n\nAlthough some of the remains of these buildings have fallen between the shattered bits of §Y[starless_shattered.GetName]§!, and some have lost their footing and now wander into the mouth of §Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§!, yet most sit under tons of dust and other remains."
 starless.201.a:0 "Keep digging! But try to not fall off..."

 starless.202.name:0 "Oversight"
 starless.202.desc:0 "Deciphering the language and systems used by these ancient settlers has confirmed our suspicions that the colonial efforts of the colony were abandoned quickly, leaving everything behind. Apparently §Y[starless_shattered.GetName]§! was once a lush, albeit hot and dry, world, which seems bizarre when factoring the black-hole system it inhabits and its proximity to it.\n\nPerhaps continuing our search will lead to more answers?"
 starless.202.a:0 "Curious."

 starless.203.name:0 "Close call"
 starless.203.desc:0 "Digging through the final remains of the colony's databanks has revealed that the colony was in its first stages relatively close to the collapse of the star that it was orbiting. At which point §Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§! did collapse and promptly tore §Y[starless_shattered.GetName]§! to pieces, rapidly ending the settlement's colonization efforts.\n\nThankfully it appears that the colony was evacuated in time, after the more dire signs of the system's demise became apparent. It also explains the state that the planet was in before its collapse, the rapidly expanding star it orbited generated much more heat, rendering the surface of the planet habitable. It appears that the civilization was so rushed in its efforts to colonize the planet that they did not notice their impending doom, perhaps something of greater importance was on their mind?"

 starless.300.desc:0 "At a glance, it would appear that §Y[starless_broken.GetName]§! was torn apart by §Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§!, but preliminary analysis of the planet reveals that it may have succumbed to its fate without the help of the Black Hole, or perhaps even prior to it. It may be worth looking into this before we venture too far out of our home system."
 starless.300.a:0 "Intriguing."

 starless.301.name:0 "Grand Operation"
 starless.301.desc:0 "The first digging operations on the remains of §Y[starless_broken.GetName]§! reveal what appears to be ancient, planetary-scale drilling equipment. Most of it with some sort of orbital positioning systems, it is curious that they lay strewn about the surface of the planet, most of it in rough shape, even for it being some few thousand years old.\n\nBy the evidence of large craters, tunnel networks, and huge, but neatly carved, crevices exposed by the planet's broken surface, we believe that the equipment had some sort of terraforming or mining purpose, but it was certainly done after the formation of the black hole, which is itself a few million years old."
 starless.301.a:0 "Keep digging!"

 starless.302.name:0 "Over-drilled"
 starless.302.desc:0 "Further analysis and excavation has proved that the equipment found was indeed mining and drilling equipment. From what we can make out based on old, translated records and logs, §Y[starless_broken.GetName]§! once had bountiful amounts of very-rare resources within it, prompting its enormous mining operations.\n\nIt wasn't long, however, before the equipment and planet gave out, unleashing a catastrophic chain of equipment malfunctions and tectonic destabilization, most likely the reason as to why the wrecked equipment we found was, well, wrecked.\n\nThe planet, ultimately over-drilled and worn-out, broke apart, prompting an abandonment of the mining operation before the planet's core exploded under the stress."
 starless.302.a:0 "Boom!"

 starless.303.name:0 "What Remains"
 starless.303.desc:0 "Digging into the final remains of the ancient §Y[starless_broken.GetName]§! mining operation, we were able to find some of these infamous rare resources that some old empire was so desperate to have themselves.

 starless.400.desc:0 "Our scientific advancement enabling us to leave and explore beyond our home system have actually revealed something quite interesting on the frozen wasteland that is §Y[starless_barrencold.GetName]§!, apparently the planet's surface is home to an abandoned building of some sort.

 starless.400.a:0 "Curious."

 starless.401.name:0 "Laboratory"
 starless.401.desc:0 "After finally managing to get inside the structure, which itself seems fairly rudimentary, it is quite evident that this building served as some sort of remote research outpost. Ancient computers, databanks, and various assortments of research equipment.\n\nTheir are currently no clues beyond this however. The equipment and materials at hand seem like basic research equipment, nothing that would necessitate a remote, frozen station in the system of a Black Hole."
 starless.401.a:0 "Keep digging!"

 starless.402.name:0 "Data, Data, Data"
 starless.402.desc:0 "Deciphering the language of this old alien station reveals that only a few researchers, roughly 3 or four, actually worked the station, and hardly ever left it. As we looked into the available databanks we were able to find evidence that this outpost served some sort of data-collecting purpose. Millions of graphs, charts, spreadsheets, and quite random data points about anything and everything, fluctuations in §Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§!'s gravitational patterns, the brightness of stars billions of light-years away, soil quality over multiple decades, or how attracted each scientist was to their chair (seriously).\n\nThe current-running theory is that these were madmen of some sort who built their own research station for reasons that can only be imagined."
 starless.402.a:0 "Odd."

 starless.403.name:0 "Mad Indeed"
 starless.403.desc:0 "Upon further digging, these scientists, indeed, were mad. Or more specifically, went mad. Looking at the patterns of their collected data, it became very sporadic and baseless in the last few decades of the outpost's lifespan, before the scientists, driven mad by the confined space and monotone life ended up taking their own lives.\n\nWe have yet to know exactly why they were here in the first place, however."
 starless.403.a:0 "See what else you can find."

 starless.404.name:0 "Exiled"
 starless.404.desc:0 "Finally finding the first few reports of these bunch of mad scientists tells us they were exiled. Previously reputed scientists on the capital planet of their empire, they were cast out when pushing forward a theory that some random subspace signals they had picked up were actually the war sounds of an extra-galactic race coming to kill them all (could you imagine?!).\n\nPortrayed as mad and paranoid, the scientists were discredited and thrown out of their empire, eventually pooling everything that they had together in order to build this remote little outpost in the least suspecting place, the barren, cold, desolate, wasteland of §Y[starless_barrencold.GetName]§! where they waited out their days in search of these so-told extra-galactic invaders."
 starless.404.a:0 "What happened next?"

 starless.405.name:0 "Without a Trace"
 starless.405.desc:0 "The final days of operations of the outpost are a bit of a mess in its archives, but apparently the invaders not only existed, did actually come to this galaxy. Going straight to the §Y[starless_barrencold.GetName]§! outpost, apparently they were attracted to whatever means the scientists were using to find the extra-galactic aliens. But the moment they finally arrived at the system (apparently with thousands of ships), ended up being the same moment that §Y[Root.Capital.GetStarName]§! collapsed into the Black Hole it is today!\n\nPretty-much instantly swallowing the entire alien fleet, never to be seen again.\n\nMost conveniently, there was therefore no sign whatsoever of the existence of these extra-galactic aliens, which lead to the scientists' suicides as they descended into madness in their fruitless efforts to convince their homeworld that they were, indeed, not crazy."

The ancient processes and systems appear to be our original programming, with only recent developments reactivating the old networks and creating a new consciousness, though they are also the reason behind the apparent conflict for the containment of these past protocols.\n\nIf we choose to not reactivate the central systems, their unrecoverable state would leave no choice but to destroy them, as integration would prove to difficult in our technological state.

 guardian.1001.desc:0 "The mega structure is vast. Probably having as much, if not more, usable space than all of the buildings on our home world. The archaeological team have been able to find what appears to be the central power source of the structure, but not much of it is left, and its technology is far too advanced for us to even begin to comprehend its existence.\n\nAlthough the structure was definitely not built to suit our species, the team has managed to adapt to the environment and even find some rather useful information on how the structure operates."

 guardian.1002.desc:0 "Diving deeper in to the structure, it appears to have served some sort of scientific purpose. Thousands of rooms with equipment, machines, and computers, with hundreds more open spaces and hall-like rooms scattered across the megastructure. The archeological team has managed to uncover some of the research (though any stored information is long since gone) that the previous owners worked on, which will come in handy in our own research.\n\nWhat appears strange though, is the way in which the entire structure appears to be bent and dented towards a particular room, as if strongly attracted by some force."
 guardian.1002.a:0 "Curious."

 guardian.1003.name:0 "Gone Awry"
 guardian.1003.desc:0 "With more time and exploration, the team concludes that the central room served as some sort of particle accelerator, smashing atoms together. However, one of the experiments must have gone horribly wrong, has it appears that when smashing two particles together, the absurd density created formed a miniature black hole. Naturally, the new micro-singularity completely destroyed the entire laboratory complex, and was only contained when the power source failed from the extreme bend in space-time and proceeded to wipe out most of the megastructure.\n\nHaving no records left of who built this massive structure, we are left only with the warning of past mistakes, and some helpful hints for our own research. One thing to note, however, is that the critical failure and later explosion of the power source of the structure had unleashed considerable amounts of radiation throughout the star system, and would explain how life could have started on our home world, especially given its otherwise unlikely placement in the system."

The archeological team, however, has discovered that the design does seem to be rather well thought-out however. All of the spikes function as electrical conductors, all leading to a central computer.\n\nDeemed to be similar to antennae, due to their hyper-sensitivity to fluctuations in space-time, the reaching tendrils were probably used to monitor activity throughout space, though to an unexplored extent."

Although they have enabled us to adapt the technology to more usable sensor technology, it appears that array's central core has received significant damage, very similar to the kind of damage a ship would receive if shot at."

 guardian.2003.name:0 "Cracked"
 guardian.2003.desc:0 "The archeological team has determined that the damage sustained to the central spire and core computer of the array were in fact self-inflicted. Due to the extreme sensitivity of the antennae to fluctuations in space and time, which allowed it to almost instantly detect the movements of any object in the galaxy and beyond, when the ancient, long forgotten builders of the array started experiment with some sort of time-travel technology, the fluctuations were so powerful that they shattered the central core of the array. Too sensitive to its creators' own inventions, the core of the spire crumpled under the sheer magnitude of the distortion of the space-time continuum.\n\nNow useless and beyond repair, the entire structure was left abandoned in the cold, empty space. Overtime pillaged for anything noteworthy, and with not trace of the builders anywhere, theories run wild from self-annihilation to intrinsic retreat. Needless to say, what is left can still greatly advance our own scientific research."

To enemy combatants, the installation must have been seen as a priority target to inflict the most damage on the enemy empire's morale... or perhaps it was just sacked by pirates, there is no sure way to tell this much time later.\n\nWe have still been able to recover many artifacts from the installation, as well as further our own knowledge about its design and construction.
