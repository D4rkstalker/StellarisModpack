Given the previous failure to notice this location earlier, these are likely to be of great scientific value.\n\nThese artificial structures react so weakly to our conventional orbital scans that, until our recent development of the new Tachyon Sensor suite now deployed on our stations. Our [Root.GetScienceDepartment] cannot find any explanation for the aforementioned properties of these artificial structures. As of this time, we must assume that the original owners of these man-made structures may have a technological level far in excess of our own.\n\nOur [Root.GetScienceDepartment] believes that a manned investigation of these artificial structures is required in order to obtain more information."
