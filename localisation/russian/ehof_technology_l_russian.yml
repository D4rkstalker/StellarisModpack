    tech_abstract_1:0 "Abstract Physics Theory"
    tech_abstract_1_desc:0 "Some 'laws-of-physics-breaking' phenomenons may not be explainable with quantum-mechanical approaches. A new branch of physics called 'Abstract Physics', which uses extremely unconventional and abstract mathematical and physical approaches for problem-solving, may lead to the answers for even the most absurd physical phenomenons of the universe."

    # Negative Pressure Application
    tech_negative_pressure:0 "Negative Pressure Application"
    tech_negative_pressure_desc:0 "Negative pressure is a phenomenon that has occurred before at the quantum-mechanical cassimere-effect. There it manifests in form of vacuum energy, but is unfortunately uncontrollable. Applied Abstract Physics has lead to the discovery of alternative, more useful and better applicable ways to generate and control negative pressure. It could be used within various application fields, but particularly in the manipulation of ultra-high-intensity space-distortions, like black holes."

    tech_prob_c_desc:0 "Unimaginably sensitive tachyon sensors, able to react and detect within a few thousands of planck times, are used to determine the target of a $ehof_wormhole$ before it even gets inflated by the $ehof_ehof$. This foreshadowing of wormhole targets, increases the security and precision of $ehof_ehof$ travel to an unforeseen magnitude. With this technology, our $ehof_ehof$ will be able to directly choose any destination in the galaxy, without any restrictions. Limitless possibilities await."

    # Vacuum Energy Density Resonance Stimulation

    tech_vedrs_desc:0 "The secrets we've uncovered inside the Sphere lead to the development of large scale vacuum manipulation technologies. Oscillating tachyon field projection plates, which actively control the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the higgs-field in a localized volume, through vacuum energy density resonance stimulation. This creates a local space-time bubble with a decreased vacuum energy density, with different physical laws, which will allow our $ehof_ehof$ to create absolutely stable $ehof_wormholes$, which never collapse, and even $ehof_wormholes$ that can be held open permanently."
