    pw_site_drained_paradise: "Drained Paradise"
    pw_site_drained_paradise_desc: "Readings suggest that [From.Planet.GetName] was habitable at some point in its history. Not only that, the composition of the ground, orbital position and presence of water show that the planet could have had a thriving ecosystem, lush green fields, abundance of minerals and a paradisiacal atmosphere. What could have happened to deprive this planet of life?\n\nThere are many signals of ruined buildings also present in the surface, three of which draw the most attention because of their size and key position. Maybe they hold the secret of this planet's past."
    pw_archaeology.105.name: "Empty Cornucopia"
    pw_archaeology.105.desc: "The first of these grand ruins consist of an abandoned genetic laboratory isolated from other ruins. Surrounding soil readings suggest a great diversity of nutrients used to compose the ground here and points to a planet containing a myriad of environments that housed diverse plant, animal and fungi life. One of the better preserved walls of the building revel the drawing of a cornucopia, and it seems that this was food growing and collection center in a distant past. Further analysis shows that this was the epicenter of total ecological collapse of the planet's biosphere, due to predatory harvesting practices."
    pw_archaeology.110.name: "Exhausted Tower"
    pw_archaeology.110.desc: "The second ruined location appears to be a grand solar structure of some sort, that used to consist of a heliostat with several mirror arrays pointing to a central spire that converted the captured solar energy to another form, which we could not determine. The entire structure seem to have been able to float freely following the star's zenith to maximize energy intake, but has crashed a long time ago from lack of maintenance. In proximity to the crash site, our archeologists have found the control facility of this wonderful structure, which contains records telling how the original builders were able to manipulate the atmosphere of [From.Planet.GetName], to clear the clouds for the heliostat and exploit the rain in hydropower reservoirs. The constant seeding and voiding of clouds has shredded the atmosphere of the planet to the point of catastrophe."
    pw_archaeology.115.name: "Drained Rock"
    pw_archaeology.115.desc: "The third ruin is the entrance of a gigantic mining project that permeates the entire surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Old machinery and tools here indicate a massive scale prospecting and extraction enterprise of valuable minerals of many types and uses. Unfortunately, the archaeological team also found several reports of soil erosion and land degradation caused by this excavation, and evidence that those reports were solemnly ignored; the final nail on this planets coffin.\n\nAll is not lost, however, with the data we have collected from these sites, and the employment of our own technology and resources, the science team here is fairly confident that they can bring this planet back to its verdant glory, using the established infrastructure. First we must revert the erosion processes and bring nutrients back to the ground by utilizing our own minerals."
    pw_archaeology.115.a: "Use the minerals, start the renewal process."
    pw_archaeology.120.name: "A Ground to Walk Upon"
    pw_archaeology.120.desc: "By adapting some of the old digging machines of the mining project we could rebuild the soil components and mend the earth, bringing tectonic stability and mineral nutrition back to most of the surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Care was taken to retain some of these extracting facilities for future use, provided we do not drain the minerals from the planet once again. This paves the way to revitalizing the biosphere, but is only the first step.\n\nNow the science team gaze upwards, to the atmosphere, for we must use our energy to reestablish the original gasses and jump start the water cycle."
    pw_archaeology.125.name: "A Sky Over Our Heads"
    pw_archaeology.125.desc: "Utilizing the ancient cloud manipulation facility of the heliostat, the science tem in [From.Planet.GetName] was able to revert its damaging process and refill the atmosphere with gases that will help with the settlement of life in the planet. While not entirely breathable, the newly established atmosphere is already balancing the planet temperature, protecting the surface from space radiation and waiting to receive gas exchange from life forms.\n\nThe terraforming process is almost complete, now we only need to reintroduce a stable ecosystem to harmonious maintain the achieved planetary balance."
    pw_archaeology.125.a: "We will provide the nutrients to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.125.b: "We will provide the resources to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.130.name: "Life All Around"
    pw_archaeology.130.desc: "Using the provided resources and the facilities in the abandoned cornucopia the science team has manage to revitalize the broken biosphere of [From.Planet.GetName] and reignite the vital force there. By using recovered data, we could stabilize gas exchange and food chains much faster than natural phenomenons. Finally, our scientists could breath the fresh air of the planet for the first time.\n\n[From.Planet.GetName] now blossoms with new life and proper colonization of the planet can be underway. The only caveat is that the ecosystem of the planet - the soil, the atmosphere and the living organisms - is in an unstable balance and can never recover completely, thus the ancient structures that drained the planetary living energy cannot be rebuild, but they can still serve us as they are."

    pw_site_lunar_archive: "Lunar Archive"
    pw_site_lunar_archive_desc: "There is considerable evidence of alien activity inside this moon.\n\nInitial reports suggest that this natural satellite was completely excavated and an extensive structure of unknown purpose was constructed inside. The science team speculates that this lunar complex was build by the inhabitants of the orbiting planet with advanced techniques, but could not discern its function."
    pw_archaeology.205.name: "Museum of Particles"
    pw_archaeology.205.desc: "Gaining entrance into the lunar complex was a relatively easy task, it seams that the structure was designed to be accessible and inviting. Inside, the archaeology team quickly noticed that the complex is divided in distinct sections, designated as collections and began exploring one of these chambers.\n\nThe first collection the team found presented itself as \"The Assemblage of Every Known Particle\", of which only vestiges remain. However, evidence found does suggest some great technological and power investment in maintaining a diverse collection of particles stable and in display, alongside heaps of experimental data on this field of physics. If these are to be believed, this civilization was able to maintain in stasis some elements we could only observe in the birth of stars!"
    pw_archaeology.210.name: "Library of Babel"
    pw_archaeology.210.desc: "The second collection housed in this lunar complex reveled a deep preoccupation with history and the preservation of knowledge shared by the civilization that constructed this place. It consist in a repository of non-digital data, such as alien books, maps, sound and image recordings and physical models of every kind. The collection spans several floors and will require a permanent research station in order analyze everything.\n\nWhile it is unclear if this collection served as a simple preservation of the past, or an active source of historiographical studies, it has become evident that there is a lot here to help us understand this ancient culture."
    pw_archaeology.215.name: "Mechanical Collection"
    pw_archaeology.215.desc: "As the team reaches the third collection, the purpose of this whole complex becomes more apparent. Seemingly, the moon was converted into a repository of information indistinct of area of knowledge, that was able to hold everything that civilization would produce or research.\n\nThe collection in question seems to have been constructed to hold every kind engineering model conceived, from the most simple to the utterly complex. Data from this assortment is already being transferred to our researchers in order to compare with our own mechanical evolution. While there are many insights we can draw from these designs, it is no surprise that such an advanced technology was required to construct a place like this."
    pw_archaeology.220.name: "Cradle of Worlds"
    pw_archaeology.220.desc: "The team investigating what is now known as The Lunar Archive, has come across the caveats of such a bold project: maintenance. It seems that centuries without the caretaking of diligent archivists have render most of the collections fruitless.\n\nAfter investigating many empty chambers, the archaeology team had exciting news about their findings: a collection of habitable planets. At least, what is left of an assortment of models detailing habitable conditions in galactic bodies. Most of the models have crumbled to dust, but one drew special interest: it is an almost perfect match to a planet in this system we have deemed uninhabitable. Our scientists are already reviewing the data, but it seems that the planet indeed held life at some point in its history, and more importantly, we may have the key to reviving it once again."
    pw_archaeology.225.name: "The Archive of Archives"
    pw_archaeology.225.desc: "Finally, the excavating team has reached the operational center of the Lunar Archive. They have found a marvel of documentation, an Archive of Archives. This center acts as the index of all the other collections, utilizing a surprisingly intuitive organization system, and remains the most preserved chamber of the complex.\n\nHere a permanent research station can be established, aiding any ongoing research on the orbiting planet. And, as it was designed, the Lunar Archive shall be open for all scholars who wish to research the vast repository of knowledge it provides."
    pw_archaeology.230.name: "A Grand Archive"
    pw_archaeology.230.desc: "After the recent excavation of the Lunar Archive, our intellectual circles have been discussing the possibility of organizing such project for own culture: a place where we can catalogue and analyze our history, without immaterial speculation.\n\nAfter all, We have gathered many of the techniques that could be employed in this enterprise. We would simply have to collect the contents of this massive archive."
    pw_archaeology.230.a: "A logical project for our future."
    pw_archaeology.230.b: "Our research requires no such gimmicks."

    pw_site_living_reliquary: "Living Reliquary"
    pw_site_living_reliquary_desc: "Upon one of the rocks drifting along this asteroid field, lies a titanic skeleton of some long-dead voidborn creature, similar in appearance to descriptions of the fabled Ether Drake. The carcass itself would make excellent archaeologic material, but readings also show signs of artificial constructions among the remains."
    pw_archaeology.305.name: "Bal'Fu Pilgrims"
    pw_archaeology.305.desc: "In a primary exploration of the titanic remains found drifting along the asteroid field, the archaeological team found scraps of several personal goods, such as clothing, jewelry and furniture. The objects seem to be arranged for use, as if some group employed the corpse of this Leviathan as shelter, after its demise.\n\nA closer look on surviving records of these inhabitants shows us that they called themselves \"The Bal'Fu Pilgrims\" and that they placed significant spiritual value on the dead creature.\n\nThere are no apparent signs to suggest a cause of death for this space Leviathan."
    pw_archaeology.310.name: "Codex of the Ages"
    pw_archaeology.310.desc: "Further exploration of the life inside this titanic beast shows that the Bal'Fu Pilgrims not only considered this ancient creature divine, but were very spiritual in general. There are pedestals for many of their holy relics all around the insides of the Leviathan, but very few still remain.\n\nOur archaeological team has manage to recover what is left of one of these relics: a worn leather-bound ancient codex with most of its pages missing. According to the inscriptions found on the pedestal, the Pilgrims believed this book held a description of everything that was and everything that will be.\n\nLead archeologist §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes that examination of the book could yield good results, but warns us that, according to legends, it must be done with purpose: either looking for the future or looking for the past."
    pw_archaeology.310.a: "Verify what the Codex says about the past."
    pw_archaeology.310.b: "Peek at what the Codex tells of the future."
    pw_archaeology.310.c: "We have no time for spiritual nonsense, analyse it properly."
    pw_archaeology.311.name: "Codex of Past Ages"
    pw_archaeology.311.desc: "As §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carefully decipher fragments of the Codex found in the titanic reliquary, left behind by the Bal'Fu, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] starts to apply the teachings of the ages to [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] work. The crew reports many helpful insights while conducting analyses."
    pw_archaeology.311.a: "There is knowledge to learn from the past."
    pw_archaeology.312.name: "Codex of Future Ages"
    pw_archaeology.312.desc: "As §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carefully decipher fragments of the Codex found in the titanic reliquary, left behind by the Bal'Fu, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] contacts some of [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] colleagues occupied with research in other fields. While skeptical at first, our research leaders confirm that, with the information [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] shared with them, they can conduct innovative experiments in their ares, unlocking new paths for our advancement."
    pw_archaeology.312.a: "So this is what the future was holding for us."
    pw_archaeology.313.name: "Codex of Lost Ages"
    pw_archaeology.313.desc: "As §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carefully decipher texts of the Codex found in the titanic reliquary, left behind by the Bal'Fu, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] realizes that the remaining fragments are not enoughs to make sense of the texts. Unfortunately, we can never know what knowledge this ancient book held in its time."
    pw_archaeology.313.a: "At least we can have a glimpse of their traditions."
    pw_archaeology.315.name: "Stargazing Mirror"
    pw_archaeology.315.desc: "The archaeological team investigating the ancient Bal'Fu has found another of their surviving relics: a cracked metal bowl that used to aid astronomers by reflecting the stars. Ancient records describe how the Bal'Fu used this Stargazing Mirror to search for self enlightenment, until one of their prophets received a vision of the Leviathan in the mirror, which caused them to scour the galaxy in search of this promised saviour.\n\nWhile heavily damaged, science officer §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! speculates that a ritual to gaze into the mirror can be performed as the records describe. However, once again, legends states that looking into the mirror must be done with purpose: \"One must be searching for answers inside or searching for salvation outside\". Whatever that means."
    pw_archaeology.315.a: "Attempt to search... inside?"
    pw_archaeology.315.b: "...Look for answers outside?"
    pw_archaeology.315.c: "Don't waste time, simply catalogue the findings."
    pw_archaeology.316.name: "Introspective Gaze"
    pw_archaeology.316.desc: "By looking through the Stargazing Mirror, the science team excavating the remains of the fallen Leviathan could better understand the cultural rituals the ancient Bal'Fu used in search of self enlightenment."
    pw_archaeology.316.a: "An interesting reflection of the past."
    pw_archaeology.317.name: "Extrospective Gaze"
    pw_archaeology.317.desc: "Study of the Stargazing Mirror by the science team excavating the remains of the fallen Leviathan has given the science team valuable insights on political manipulation, specially directed to establishing a presence in space. There is still doubt regarding the origin of this knowledge, but our empire can certainly reap its benefits"
    pw_archaeology.317.a: "Look forward and outward."
    pw_archaeology.320.name: "Heart of the Leviathan"
    pw_archaeology.320.desc: "Finally, the archaeological team has reached the center of the fallen Leviathan, where they have determined that the heart of the creature should be. And it is still here!\n\nSurrounded by the skeletal remains of the Bal'Fu, a dark reflective irregular rock sits at the center of the thoracic cavity of the titanic beast. The corpses are the first specimens of the Bal'Fu we have encountered and they seem to have congregated here at the time of their deaths. In fact, new analyses show that both the Pilgrims and the Leviathan perished at about the same time, which points to a new hypothesis that the Bal'Fu lived inside the Leviathan while it was still alive!\n\nReadings show strange energy emissions coming the heart of the Leviathan, we can respect the ancient traditions of the Bal'Fu Pilgrims and maintain the heart here, studying the remains of their conclave or take the heart to be analyzed in our labs."
    pw_archaeology.320.a: "Preserve the Heart here for study and pilgrimage."
    pw_archaeology.320.b: "Take the Heart to a laboratory for study."
    pw_archaeology.330.name: "A Reliquary of Our Own"
    pw_archaeology.330.desc: "After the recent excavation of the Living Reliquary, our theologians and scholars have been discussing the possibility of organizing such project for own faith: a place where we can sanctify the relics of our past that define our culture, much like the ones found inside the dead Leviathan.\n\nWhile the prospect of finding a void creature to house our artifacts is amusing, we should construct a building for that task. Specially if that building is to be a wonder to behold."
    pw_archaeology.330.a: "A blessed project for our future."
    pw_archaeology.330.b: "Our faith requires no such gimmicks."

    pw_site_translunar_network: "Translunar Archive"
    pw_site_translunar_network_desc: "This moon shows signs of civilization and culture, but readings confirm that there is no evidence that it was habitable at any point in time. Maybe there are secrets to life that we are yet to discover?"
    pw_archaeology.405.name: "Crater Entrance"
    pw_archaeology.405.desc: "The archaeological team was surprised to find entrances in many of the craters of this moon that did not show up in preliminary readings. They lead to an expansive tunnel complex that seems to connect much of the surface of the moon in a logistic network. Tools and equipment found suggest that the network of tunnels served both as a mining project and as a channel of distribution.\n\nThere are still no indication that the moon supported life at any point, but the presence of some type of civilization maintains suspicion. Maybe the answers lies deeper."
    pw_archaeology.410.name: "Specimen Analysis"
    pw_archaeology.410.desc: "While exploring further the depths of this moon, the archaeological team found several conserved remains of its former inhabitants. They appear to have been a lithoid species that subsisted on the excavated minerals found here, giving the tunnels another purpose. Further analysis shows that they were not native to this moon and that minerals here were not as nutritional to them as they were used to. Culturally, they seem to have had collectivist tendencies, as there are sings that the tunnels were designed to provide the entire satellite with the needed sustenance and scarce comforts they could spare."
    pw_archaeology.415.name: "Living Caverns"
    pw_archaeology.415.desc: "Many underground galleries were found while exploring the tunnel network. While most appear to have been excavated in search of minerals, some of them seem to have been used as living space. The presence of a diverse array of tools and equipment indicate advanced cultural production - even with a harsh life in a barren rock, the lithoid species never gave up on their artistic endeavors and expression.\n\nAnalysis of surviving records indicate that this species called themselves \"Rukkir\" and that the community established here were the survivors of a great purge, promulgated by a foreign empire. In fact, our researchers speculate that this may have been the last group of Rukkir in the entire galaxy!"
    pw_archaeology.415.a: "Keep digging!"
    pw_archaeology.420.name: "Stone Storage"
    pw_archaeology.420.desc: "More underground caves found withing the rukkirian complex of tunnels yielded interesting results. The archaeological team found several chambers dedicated to the storage and distribution of minerals and other products consumed by the the Rukkir. These chambers and the connecting tunnels form an elegant logistic system that guaranteed that every member of this community could provide what they were able, while satisfying their needs as best as possible, with no regards for hierarchical positions. It is the common opinion among the excavating team that the Rukkir would not have survived for as long as they did, if it were not for their strong sense of community and care for each of their members.\n\nThe team also discovered that the Rukkir were able to escape detection from their assailants by utilizing the properties of rare crystals in this moon to confuse sensors and avoid their complete genocide."
    pw_archaeology.425.name: "The Final Stand"
    pw_archaeology.425.desc: "The last evidence the archaeological team could find on the Rukkir shows that their plan of diversion did not work forever, and they were ultimately discovered and decimated by their great enemy. It seems that the technological advancements of this genocidal empire were too fast and they could pierce the crystalline distortion by using different sensory techniques.\n\nEven with the species disappearance, the work the Rukkir left behind does not need to be wasted, as there are still many extracted minerals, crystals and motes here. Our own species could benefit from the constructed facilities here."
    pw_archaeology.430.name: "A Planetary Tunnel System"
    pw_archaeology.430.desc: "The recent excavation of the last home of the Rukkir and examination of their life style and social organization has piqued the interest of many community leaders in our empire. There are many movements pushing for the establishment of similar distribution systems in our own planets, should the technology allow.\n\nThis would be indeed the perfect way to guarantee that most, if not all, the needs of our population are met equally."
    pw_archaeology.430.a: "All shall benefit from this research."
    pw_archaeology.430.b: "Our community has no need for this."
