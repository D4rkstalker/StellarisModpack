It has become clear to us that we need to expand the infrastructure of the facility in order to maintain the high quality of our results.\n\nResearcher of the Dome have also drafted the experiment collection they will explore in sequence. It will focus on governance and the manufacturing of a social body, even if that social body is composed of a single being."

    pw_research.2111.desc: "By erasing the memory of the population in the $pw_domed_city$ and instilling different material and immaterial conditions on some individuals, with the purpose of promoting divisions, we can investigate the development of social constructs and how they can divide or unite a community. If we were to investigate further this topic, we could fabricate our own social constructs in order to manipúlate the ambition of our people."

    pw_research.2112.name: "Governmental Experiments: Manufacturing Consent"
    pw_research.2112.desc: "It is no mystery that politics is a creative combination of consent and coercion; the latter when the former fails. The cultivation of varied societies within the $pw_domed_city$ has allowed us to document and study a myriad of combinations of the two, as well as processes in which consent is fabricated. If the country would define from what right does it rule, we can supply the proper techniques to maintain that right to power, using what we have discovered."

    pw_research.2113.desc: "Recent experiments in the $pw_domed_city$ have simulated war zones and conflict areas, modeling different tactics, army deployment, logistics lines and fortification disposition. Among other results, these experiments have found that both a military and a society benefit from being aligned with each other. If a society envisions pacifism, its armies are much more effective if they attempt to deescalate conflicts. If the martial organization reflects the hierarchy of society, both are more motivated. When the armies of Gestalt organisms battle in synchrony, it is clearly more effective.\n\nThis may sound logical, but trough the experimentation we have identified sever points where our armies could be better aligned with with our own values."

    pw_research.2114.desc: "As our researchers prepare to finalize the experiments on the $pw_domed_city$, they have noticed a gas leak within certain sectors of the Dome. The gas is a synthesis of several Exotic Gases that were in use on the facility. According to observations, this substance seem to have a calming and sedative effect on organic beings, that display complacency with minimal side effects.\n\nNot only can this accident yield interesting observations, but it has inspired our researcher to draft a new batch of experiments based on exotic substances. Particularly, exotic gases seem to have a variety of effects that need to be catalogued, when combined with other substances. The mysterious Zro could also be included among the experiments."

    pw_research.2115.desc: "With so many varied societies we have investigated in the $pw_domed_city$, special attention has been given in two situations where power rests: in times of scarcity and in times of abundance. The researchers here could focus in one or the other, to supply our politicians with the proper measures in the right time."

    pw_research.2121.desc: "Experiments with exotic substances on $pw_domed_city$ the started with the wrong step. An unexpected reaction has occurred with the first few substances tested, that have lead the subjects exposed to them to distrust the decoys present within the Dome. They have uncovered the cameras and sensors we use and attempted to destroy all of our equipment, before they could be stopped.\n\nWhile we will require some time to repair the facility, at least we discovered that exposure to certain substances can allow our researchers to see outside the box. We only need to identify the right combination, that does not cause paranoia."

    pw_research.2124.desc: "As the elaborated experiments on the $pw_domed_city$ come to an end, our scientific community is divided. Half are content with the discoveries and are eager to see which application of the mysterious Zro will we choose, as it has many different effects, specially on the development of life and when applied to the circuitry of some machines. The other half, on the other hand, argued that we are simply beginning to understand this substance, and that the applications may be boundless.\n\nA project to expand the $pw_domed_city$ and focus its study on the effects of Zro is already being drawn. It will be an observatory of psionic manifestations, in any form it may have, design to contain and study such anomalies."

Tests conducted here already guarantee that our industry and voidcraft is cutting edge.\n\nHowever, without systematic organization, engineering projects are simply fancy inventions, that will never be more that prototypes.

An accident with experiments that aimed at improving bombardment damage have caused massive destruction of surrounding infrastructure. A response team is already on their way to contain the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, that same test has excavated further the depths of our test crater. The massive pressure, quality of minerals and composition of our missiles have created a form of unrefined Living Metal at the bottom, that responds unexpectedly to external stimuli. This could represent grand future investigations if we can extract it."
