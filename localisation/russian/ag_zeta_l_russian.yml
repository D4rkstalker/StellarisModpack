 ag_zeta.11.d.response:0 "This is one of the first research facilities to be attacked by the Shroud Invaders. \n\nA long time ago, probably at the beginning of $ag_age_of_psionics$, the creators began to study psionics on a large scale after seeing $ag_zroni_civilization$'s ability to control psionics that died out due to the civil war. At that time, the creators did not know that such large-scale research was very dangerous, and the first few accidents were not serious and did not attract their attention, until the Shroud Invaders penetrated the psionic network and start attacking them.\n\nMy facility used to be researching the use of psionic construction materials... and I am not sure about the specific content, but because the creators built a psionic conduit connected with the $ag_shroud$ here, the Shroud Invaders made here became a stronghold after occupying this place. Later, the creators’ navy came over and fought for a long time with the Shroud Invaders, destroying the psionic conduit. The Shroud Invaders did not want to lose this area, and created a psionic portal near here, the creators We fought a few battles with the Shroud Invaders, and finally closed the psionic portal here.\n\nWhat you see near my facility now is that most of the wreckage is left over from previous battles. The creators didn't clean them up until they left, so they stayed here. Of course, there are still some wrecks left by unobedient visitors. They always don’t listen to advice, so I can only leave them here ……"
 ag_zeta.11.e.response:0 "This ...To be honest, I don’t know how to answer you very clearly. The Shroud Invaders is something that $ag_zroni_civilization$ left in the $ag_shroud$. The creators seem to have mentioned ... Something like the remnants of the $ag_divine$'s collective consciousness. \n\nAfter the civil war of $ag_zroni_civilization$, the creators, like the only survivor of the $ag_saviors$, thought that the $ag_divine$ had been completely wiped out, but this was obviously not the case. They must still have some consciousness remaining in the $ag_shroud$. They found that the creators were studying psionics on a large scale, they tried to use the energy provided by the creators to the $ag_shroud$ to rebuild themselves, but the creators' security system prevented them from doing so, so they chose to attack the creators. \n\nAfter the war, the Shroud Invaders were destroyed by the creators, or they were dismantled into many fragments and pulled out from the $ag_shroud$. However, in order to protect $ag_shroud$’s psionic environment, the creators chose to isolate these fragments through a series of slow processes to destroy them, so today you can see many restricted areas."
 ag_zeta.11.f.response:0 "Because the Shroud Invaders are really very dangerous, although the current Shroud Invaders have only fragments left ... maybe they will be completely destroyed soon, but their special psionic structure makes them still able to be released. It can cause huge damage, and may even produce things like star-level psionic storms or new psionic portals. Most of the energy in my facility must be used to maintain a barrier to control the Shroud Invaders. \n\nYou said that you can protect yourself... Maybe you can, but if you are using the defense system in my facility as a reference, it is not necessarily true. The creators believe that civilizations that are capable and willing to break into the restricted area are also capable of responding to the threat of the Shroud Invaders, and then took away a lot of things in my facilities. I even suspect that if there is an omission in my work, I  may not be able to control the escape of the Shroud Invaders. \n\nIn any case, even if you are really capable of resisting the Shroud Invaders, you may suffer a lot of unnecessary losses in the battle with them. Rather than thinking about how to break into my facility, what's so bad about letting the Shroud Invaders be destroyed by nature at here?"

They've been near my facility for a long time, but they're happy to abide by the restrict protocol, not become cold debris floating in space.\n\nAh, it's a bit off the subject, and I talked with them for quite a while after that, until they withdrew their parent cluster, L cluster, for some reason they didn't want to tell me. They have told me some of the details of building a gateway to the L cluster, although I may never use them ......\n\nBy the way, if you need these details, I can transfer them to the past, but because my storage facilities are a little bit broken, it may not be so complete."

The process of guiding energy from the $ag_shroud$ to our time is affected by the entities in the $ag_shroud$.
