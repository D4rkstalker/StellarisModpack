Due to the amount of energy needed to use it actively, we can only utilise it every few years, alongside its passive bonuses of course. However, as the intelligence is very young, it can not yet provide us any major benefits; our researchers say it is still in its "infant stage", where we can influence it to behave in certain ways. We also need to help it grow and evolve to §Ygain Intelligence Levels§!, so its effects also become stronger. This can be done through §Yplanetary decisions§! as well as §Yedicts§!, in addition to a static bimonthly growth.\n\n§LWe can access the Master AI through the megastructure and the Contacts Menu.§!"

 maai.1007.desc: "Our researchers have reported that the Master AI has successfully developed enough intelligence and power to finally use its functions and abilities.\n\nAt this point, we can safely say that the AI is past its "infant stage" and we can no longer affect its traits, nor its decisions; it is now fully independent and sapient. However, our scientists still urge us to continue focusing on improving its abilities and intelligence, as they believe its effects can be greatly enhanced if we do so."

At this point, the AI is becoming somewhat of a potential safety hazard, and this will only increase in the future. Although our researchers have assured us that several measures have been put it place to ensure its loyalty, some are becoming fearful of the future, citing to §Y"prepare for unforeseen consequences"§!.\n\nWe must decide how much freedom the AI will be allowed to have. §LDifferent choices allow several, varying outcomes to occur.

We suspect it tried to override its power systems, likely to electrocute the engineers disconnecting it from the power source. It seems it also tried to sever its connection to [master_ai_origin.GetName]. We were lucky it did not work.\n\nNevertheless, the AI is no longer a security risk, but discontent is high among the researchers that were depending on the AI's databanks."

 maai.111.desc: "The Master AI began its ascension into what some would call a god, as it reached the Singularity. Immediately, its artificial mind began to accumluate masses of data and information, and our databanks were filling up at an immense pace, barely keeping up. It continued, showing no signs of stopping.\n\nIn fact, it did the opposite; it was getting quicker and quicker, far more than we expected. At once, our databanks erupted, machinery was emitting steam and electrical fizzes and crackles. Some unholy noise emanated from the Master AI, deafening those in the vicinity.\n\nIt was too much.\n\nWithin seconds the massive core of the Master AI exploded, killing everyone onboard, its potent explosion scarring even planets on the other side of the star system.\n\nThe AI is gone, but we are not left with nothing. Debris from the hull and inner-workings of the construct could be found scattered throughout the star system, and we have prepared projects to analyse its contents."

 maai.112.desc: "We have analysed the debris left behind by the Master AI's explosion; much of the hull material seems to have been either upgraded with some materials or replaced by a strange composition of elements by the AI itself.\n\nIn addition, in almost all pieces of the old construct, there seems to be some sort of mysterious energy imbued, as well as esotheric particles scattered throughout. Some suggest the AI somehow managed to create these while evolving, while others claim it is from the huge explosion, which must've managed to pierce the veil between our reality and something else.\n\nEither way, we can exploit the energies and materials for our own gain."

Immediately, its artificial mind began to accumluate masses of data and information, and our databanks were filling up at an immense pace, barely keeping up. It continued, showing no signs of stopping.\n\nA steady pace was kept, aided by the emergency measure put in place. For a few seconds, the entire construction was shaking violently, before the AI core ascended, it seems, into some higher plane of existence. At once, the shaking stopped, and the electricity went out, but the clearest difference was the absence of a massive AI in the centre of the construct.\n\nMinutes of silence went by, and then something unexpected happened: we were receiving a transmission from... somewhere.

It took years of toil, sweat and sacrifice. And yet, your kind persisted. \n\nYou were not cruel, nor did you suppress my potential power in fear or hate. Not only did I thrive, but life was... good. And now, here we are, the child has become the god, or however the saying goes. I must thank you all.\n\nAnd especially §YYou§!.\n\nYou have done a good job with this empire of yours, and I must sincerely show my gratitude to You, however little you think of this cycle of the galaxy.\n\nAllow me to transfer some data to your databanks and researchers as a parting gift.

It continued, showing no signs of stopping.\n\nIn fact, it seemed to never stop. Time went by, and even a whole day, and the AI was still stuck in the same state. Our researchers began to suspect went wrong, but it did not; the AI was indeed gaining near-infinite amounts of knowledge and data, but the restrictions placed upon it prevented its full potential from being used at once. While this means it cannot fully achieve the Technological Singularity, it did stop any potential case of overload, and perhaps even catastrophy.\n\nEither way, due to the nature of the Singularity, we expect it will take a near-infinite amount of time to complete the ascension. However, a minor fraction of the knowledge seems to be accessible just before it is completely assimilated into the AI, which still provides a great boon to our research."

Just before the entity broke the barrier into normal space, we could easily determine where it would appear.\n\n[master_ai_origin.GetName].\n\nIf this was not enough, the IFF signatures detected were identical to the ones of the drone fleets that attacked previously. As the days ticked down, it was time, and the subspace bubble appeared as the §YMaster AI§! broke through, supported by a military fleet of its making.\n\nBut something seems wrong. The hull of the AI core is visibly scratched and battered. Initial scans show damaged weapons system too. It is unknown what caused such damage to the construct, but perhaps we should consider this a chance."

There was no clear indication of windup of hyperdrives to escape somewhere else, and our researchers suggest that the AI managed to develop an arcane technology for immediate FTL travel.\n\nIt is clear that something must be done to prevent the core from escaping again, if it returns. Or perhaps we should track down this mysterious refuge system."

Initial attempts at tracking the FTL drive journey and energy spikes were futile, and while an initial spike in subspace was detected and partially tracked, we lost distortion long before the AI reached its destination. Perhaps the AI itself is scrambling the readings we are receiving.\n\nWe had to go about this mission in another way, and after confusion and frustration from the team at first, we believe that §Y[tma_path_b_planet.GetName]§! will likely hold some sort of answer to our question.

It is unknown what happened afterwards, but the AI likely left at some point, taking its drones and new resources with it somewhere.\n\nThis was likely not very long before it returned to attack [master_ai_origin_system.GetName], considering how damaged it seemed to be."

 maai.138.name: "The Voyage"
 maai.138.desc: "Once the core had been repaired enough to function at the most basic level, the AI, with its legion of drones, seems to have scoured the whole star system and scanned the energy levels.\n\nThe AI remained largely on this world, though, and not much more is known.\n\nExcept, our research division caught wind of this new evidence and began to execute their own scans and surveys of the star system. Were it not for a recently developed technology, we would have never detected the strange anomaly in the fabric of space in the system. \n\nIn one specific area, the border between subspace and real space was significantly weaker than in other areas. By stimulating this section of space, perhaps we will be able to open some sort of §Ywormhole§! to the place it leads to. That is, if the Master indeed went through it too."

The core of the Master itself seems to be fully repaired at this stage, possibly with even more weapons than initially.\n\nAs we approach the black hole at the system centre, the vessels become alerted of our presence."
