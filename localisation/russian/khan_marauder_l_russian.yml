 great_khan_integrate_announcement:0 "This is the Great Khan speaking, while the current situation has proven to be a beneficial structure, it is now time to begin integrating the galaxy into one nation. I take this step warily, but for the greater good. This will later be viewed as the greatest day in galactic history, the day in which all sentient life looked to the sky and saw hope. I will begin integrating states one at a time, to better ease the logistical burden."
 great_khan_integrate_response:0 "This isn't good..."
 great_khan_integrate_choice:0 "The Great Khan has begun integrating their subjects into his empire. This has obviously caused unrest, it is believe that if one state rebelled, the others would join. It would not be a united front, the galaxy has grown wary of centralized power, but we would not be alone."

 FE_war_choice:0 "The Choice"
 FE_war_choice_desc:0 "The Great Khan has declared war on one of the Elder Races in an attempt to take their technology. Interestingly, the elder race has reached out to the Great Khan's subjects, offering us the chance to serve them instead. Both sides have promised great gifts for those who side with them, and destruction for those who side against them. Alternatively we could declare our complete independence in the chaos."
 great_khan_fe_war:0 "This is the Great Khan speaking, we has taken great strides in making the galaxy safe for all sentient beings. However, the elder races still sit in isolation, with their technology, we could forge a utopia among the stars. The elder races have refused to share this technology with us, and tragically the horde must war again. You will not be required to take part in the fighting, but those who do will find themselves well rewarded."
 great_khan_fe_war_response:0 "This may present opportunity..."
 great_khan_wins_announcement:0 "This is the Great Khan, I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the nations of the galaxy that I have no intention of interfering with their internal affairs. I simply wish to make the galaxy safe for all sentient life. In order to accomplish this however, certain practices can not be tolerated, such as slavery. I do not take this step lightly, I do not wish to become the very tyrant I desire to prevent, but I do it for the greater good. I am also dedicating the resources of the Horde to rebuilding the wreckage left behind by the war. This effort will be organized by a new Federation, the Galactic Horde."
 great_khan_wins_announcement_response:0 "Fine words..."
 great_khan_wins:0 "Victory of the Great Khan"
 great_khan_wins_desc:0 "Through a combination of diplomacy and overwhelming military might, the Great Khan has succeeded in conquering the majority of the known galaxy, with only the elder races remaining independent. It would seem as if the Great Khan's vision for a galactic community will be realized, although in what form remains to be seen..."
 great_khan_wins_response:0 "Long live the Great Khan..."
 marauder_fabricator_greeting1:0 "Your industrial output is considerable,\n it has proven to be a great boon to the horde."
 marauder_fabricator_greeting2:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] industrial complex has proven to be of incredible value."
 marauder_fabricator_greeting3:0 "The horde will remember the kindness of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], you will have a special place in the society we are building."

 marauder_fabricator_deal_reason:0 "Access to the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] industrial complex."
 marauder_fabricator_offer:0 "Access to even a small portion of your industrial capacity now would be worth granting you an exception.\n If you produce warships for us, you would not have to surrender your autonomy, or provide recruits for our efforts."
 marauder_fabricator_deal_accept:0 "We will begin production immediately"
 marauder_fabricator_deal_refuse:0 "We will not support your conquest."
 marauder_fabricator_good:0 "Excellent, this will allow us to reinforce our fleets more frequently and support a larger standing force. You have saved untold billions by signing this treaty."
 marauder_fabricator_rebel:0 "We no longer wish to support your conquest"
 marauder_fabricator_disloyal:0 "We will no longer serve"

 marauder_deal_start:0 "We seek an alternate arrangement with the Horde"
 marauder_deal:0 "The satrapy system was created for a reason, it will provide an ideal transition towards a galactic community, why would I alter it?"
 marauder_deal_reason:0 "How about access to our advanced technology?"
 marauder_deal_offer:0 "Hmm, your society has made great strides in technological advancement, if you would provide this technology to the Horde, you would not have to pay tribute, or provide military recruits."
 marauder_deal_response:0 "Our technology is yours then!"
 marauder_deal_accept:0 "You have saved many lives by giving us access to this technology, it will be used for the good of the galaxy."
 marauder_deal_bad_response:0 "No, we will not share our technology with you."
