However, this one does not have the strange mark on its brain, and it seems to have been stabbed by someone. \n\nOn the computer, the very same messaging program that was last used, was on the screen. It reads: 'The council have made the vote. They're going to sweep Niten in three hours; no matter if there are any soldiers here or not. I need you to send a ship. Please hurry.

The Hive Mind wasn't natural; it was made by some ambitious scientists! \n\nSome of our scientists investigated the implants in more detail.

 #qfts.16a:0 "Who are you?" 
 #qfts.16a.response:0 "We are, or rather, were, the Shivkonians. We were once united and peaceful, but when a dictator took over the empire, he wanted the people to do exactly what he said, without question. Naturally, the people didn't want to do that, and they began to riot. He and his scientists created a brain implant of sorts, which was implanted into every person they could find. A special one was given to the dictator, which was wirelessly connected to the Alpha Nexus, on Varnoll. They became an artificial Hive Mind." 
 #qfts.16b:0 "What happened to Tesfin?" 
 #qfts.16b.response:0 "Well you see, not everyone was found. A group of rebels led a revolution against the Hive. To escape the military drones, they fled to Tesfin, where they set up base. The Hive was already aggressively observing the primitives on the planet, known to us as the Flistonals. They recruited some primitives and taught them what to do, but the Shivkonian Hive had other plans. \n\nThey used a weapon, what can only be described as a Planet Killer, to obliterate the world. This was a massive setback for the resistance. Luckily for them, some other rebels took control of Poldan already." 
 #qfts.16c:0 "Why is Niten... the way it is?" 
 #qfts.16c.response:0 "It may seem like an infection to your kind, but it was considered a paradise by the Hive Mind. Not only that, it was rendered completely inhabitable for any other species. It was the capital of the Shivkonians. You may not have noticed, but there is little to no life on the planet now. \n\nAlthough it has been a long time, the planet was, in a way, destroyed. The Planet Killer that was used against is was now used against them. We had our own design, but the main difference was that we were humane. We did not want to destroy our old home, so we used the power of neutrons. The entire planet was swept by a wave of neutrons, and any living thing was killed." 
 #qfts.16d:0 "What is the military complex on Varnoll?" 
 #qfts.16d.response:0 "Oh, that's Alpha Nexus. It was the core of the Hive, which kept the brain implants working and connected to the main one. It was later repurposed as a military base to fight the rebellion. Soon, the enemy Planet Killer was getting ready at the base, to destroy Poldan. However, we had an advantage. My people had a remote control, which could deactivate the Hive. As soon as the killer got in orbit, I would flip the switch to destroy the Hive. Well, I wouldn't flip it though; there were too many allies on Varnoll. But they didn't know that. \n\nLittle did we know, the base on Varnoll had another weapon. They covered the entire world in a shield; nothing could get in. \n\nNothing could get out." 
 #qfts.16e:0 "What happened after that?" 
 #qfts.16e.response:0 "I do not know. \n\nBy that point, there were only pockets of rebels on Niten. We had no hope. At the same time, chaos fell upon Poldan. Many died, few survived, but just barely. It is clear that the Shivkonian Hive eventually fell, but how that came to happen, I don't know." 
 #qfts.16f:0 "Are you... the seeders?" 
 #qfts.16f.response:0 "...No, that's not possible... \n\n You, are you the [Species.GetNamePlural]? \n\nYou see, before the implants were used on the population, the dictator allowed his scientists to experiment ways to create an artificial Hive Mind. You were one of the civilisations we experimented on. Obviously, your kind survived, and it worked, but there were no clear immediate effects, so they just thought that it didn't work..."
