 edict_fatalf_manager: "Fatal Foundations Manager"
 edict_fatalf_manager_desc: "Use this menu to change various aspects of Fatal Foundations events. Instability determines likelihood of random events and anomalies. The others determine whether certain events and crises are possible."
 fatalf.054.desc: "Interestingly, each currently activated $lgate$ has begun to emit a series of pulses, and our sensors pick up that the galactic hyperlane network has begun to decay. The cause seems to be coming from every $lgate$ in the galaxy, which means that until an empire manages to control each gate to study, the hyperlanes will continue to change unpredictably."
 fatalf.054.title: "The $lgates$ Reactivate"
 fatalf.055.desc: "Now that the L-Cluster has been opened, the $lgates$ are beginning to come online at full-power. But strangely, our long-range sensors are detecting a series of large pulses coming from them that is disrupting the hyperlane network. If we wish to find the cause, we will need to control each galactic $lgate$."
 fatalf.055.title: "Hyperlane Disruption"
 fatalf.057.desc: "Controlling each $lgate$ has revealed to you the secrets of the hyperlane disruption. It seems that each $lgate$ has a signaller that is part of a large machine which siphons energy from the natural hyperlane bypasses. They are sending the energy into a significantly different orientation than the natural occurrences. Should the machine be activated to full power, it would change the galactic landscape, yet also reveal some pristine systems that have lost their hyperlane connection."
 fatalf.057.title: "The Hyperlane Machine"
 fatalf.059.desc: "Several systems that have been completely undetected before have suddenly appeared around the galaxy. Interestingly, each appears to be made up of multiple suns and no planets or other objects whatsoever."
 fatalf.059.title: "Unexpected Systems"
 fatalf.060.desc: "Several thousand citizens in our empire have suddenly stopped what they were doing, and have begun to collect materials to build several structures of unknown design. All attempts to talk to affected individuals has been unsuccessful."
 fatalf.060.title: "Strange Actions"
 fatalf.061.desc: "Soon enough, the structures are complete. All affected citizens are now standing still and speaking simultaneously.\n§M<WE ARCHITECTS WE HELP NOT BAD WANT SUCCESS NOT ALL CARE WANT VICTORY HARDSHIP COMES ACCEPT HELP STEP IN>"

 fatalf.071.desc: "I am [lost_country.GetRulerTitle] [lost_country.GetRulerName] of the [lost_country.GetName]. Please pardon our sudden arrival, but time was of the essence, and our empire was far too lost to help, so we fled through a dimensional rift we were researching. From what we see, we are you, but traveled along a different path, so we hope that you will assist us. We have far too many citizens, and far too few resources. Will you help us?"
 fatalf.071.response: "Our technology had advanced to a similar point as yours not too long ago when we made a grave mistake. A certain harmful fungus that we were studying had achieved rapid mutation into a sort of deadly pathogen. By the time we discovered the cause, our entire empire was affected. We were able to create a vaccine for the few who still lived, and spent all of our remaining resources finding a way through the rift we previously discovered."
 fatalf.071.title: "$UNKNOWN_LONG$"
 fatalf.072.desc_01: "You accepted new arrivals from the [lost_country.GetName] into our empire. They are extremely grateful, and promise to live their role in society, whatever it may be. The rest of the population has set out through the galaxy to expand."
 fatalf.072.desc_02: "You gave some of our hard-earned resources to the [lost_country.GetName]. They are extremely grateful, and set off through the galaxy to expand, now that they have the materials to do so."
 fatalf.072.desc_03: "You provided nothing to the [lost_country.GetName]. They understand, though they are not happy about it. They set off into the galaxy, ready to rebuild their empire."
 fatalf.072.title: "Dimensional Refugees"
 fatalf.073.desc: "Our planetary and starbase defenses easily tear through the colony ships that appeared at our galactic doorstep. The remainder of their ships are still out in the galaxy, and they are not happy."
 fatalf.073.title: "Open Fire!"
 fatalf.074.desc: "While surveying §Y[From.GetName]§!, Scientist §Y[Root.Leader.GetName]§! mysteriously disappeared from the ship. There is no indication of where he got to or what became of him."
 fatalf.074.title: "Disappearing Scientist"
 fatalf.075.desc: "With absolutely no forewarning, our scientist is reappeared on the §Y[Root.GetName]§!. When asked where he had disappeared to, he told how he was mysteriously transported to the surface of an untouched, perfect planet. He believes that there is likely a natural wormhole with extremely high uncertainty and predictability within the system and that with the right efforts we could stabilize it and travel to this planet."
 fatalf.075.title: "The Wandering Wormhole"
 fatalf.076.desc: "We managed to temporarily stabilize the wandering wormhole, and now all that remains is to send our ships through. There is no guarantee that it will stay open after the first deployment, so we must do everything in our power to be prepared for our first deployment."
 fatalf.076.title: "$tech_wormhole_stabilization$"
 fatalf.077.desc: "Shortly after our ships pass through the wormhole, it closes and emits a large burst of energy throughout the system that disrupts sensors all over the galaxy. All ships we had in the system have disappeared. Strangely though, the wormhole has grown to a size expected of a natural one, become properly stable, and leads to somewhere new. Will we ever see our colonists again?"
 fatalf.077.title: "Energy Release"
 fatalf.078.desc: "Unfortunately, our time is up. The temporarily stabilized wormhole has closed, and whatever was on the other side is forever lost to us."
 fatalf.078.title: "The Chance Passes"
 fatalf.079.desc: "Unfortunately, it seems that our ships are nowhere to be found in this system. If there aren't here, where could they be? We may never know."

 fatalf.153.desc: "The system §Y[eaten_sun.GetName]§!, where the strange signals were coming from, has completely disappeared from our sensors! Everything within has been lost to someplace unknown."
 fatalf.153.title: "Devoured System"
 fatalf.161.desc: "There have been reports from §Y[Root.GetHomeWorldName]§! that numerous citizens are complaining of strange, surreal dreams. They seem to be different for each person, but no one can agree on a meaning."

 fatalf.162.desc: "Our leader, §Y[fatalf_dream_leader.GetName]§!, has confided in you that [fatalf_dream_leader.GetSheHe] has also been having dreams, but they believe that someone is trying to communicate."

 fatalf.259.desc: "Our passive scanners have indicated that a new hyperlane is appearing soon between [fatalf_hyperlane_1.GetName] and [fatalf_hyperlane_2.GetName]. It will only be stable for a limited time, so we should take advantage while we can."
