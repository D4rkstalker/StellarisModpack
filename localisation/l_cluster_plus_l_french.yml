 START_SCREEN_LCLUSTERPLUS_ORIGIN:0 "After fighting the Gray Tempest for centuries, the infrastructure of our empire had started to collapse. No longer being able to hold our positions against the nanites, we were forced to go into hiding in secret military bunkers hidden deep beneath the surface of our capital planet. We knew they would eventually find us; it was only a matter of time.\n\nWhen all hope was lost, the central command system of the nanite factory suffered a critical failure causing the entire nanite armada to collapse. We can only speculate what caused the factory to break down, but one thing is for sure: the nanites are dead. Now that they are defeated, we can begin to rebuild our once mighty empire."

 LCLUSTER_PROJECT_OVERWRITE:0 "Activate L-Gate"
 LCLUSTER_PROJECT_OVERWRITE_DESC:0 "Our scientists are now confident that our knowledge of the L-Gates and the technology behind them is sufficient to abort their maintenance cycle. If the attempt is successful, the L-Gate in the §H[candidate_gateway_system.GetName]§! system should allow immediate access to the entire L-Gate Network.\n\nAs the maintenance cycle ends, all L-Gates in the galaxy will become operational as their self-correcting software readjusts. Finally, we will be able to reach the other side!"
 lclusterplus.7.name:0 "The Ancient Gateway"
 lclusterplus.7.desc:0 "We have received exciting news from the crew of one of our science ships; according to their reports, the §HL-Gate§! in the §HTerminal Egress§! system is still intact even after all these years! It is still stuck in the maintenance cycle caused by our ancestors, meaning that their efforts to trap the Gray Tempest in the §HL-Cluster§! were successful, and the nanites had no way of escaping into the galaxy. Unfortunately, this means we are trapped in here as well... for now at least.\n\nWhile a lot of our research and technologies have been lost during the war with the Gray Tempest, our scientists believe they could end the maintenance cycle should we invest resources into researching the L-Gate, and attempt to understand this ancient piece of technology."
 lclusterplus.10.name:0 "Link Established"
 lclusterplus.10.desc.a:0 "Success! Our technicians managed to abort the maintenance cycle, and the lockdown has been removed from the L-Gate in the [candidate_gateway_system.GetName] system. For the first time in eons, the §HL-Cluster§! can now be accessed from our galaxy!\n\nHowever, it appears that the L-Cluster is not the only thing on the other side of the gateway. We are receiving faint radio signals coming from the §HTerminal Egress§! system!"
 lclusterplus.10.desc.b:0 "Success! Our technicians managed to abort the maintenance cycle, and the lockdown has been removed from the L-Gate in the [candidate_gateway_system.GetName] system. For the first time in eons, the §HL-Gate Network§! is once again operational, and we are no longer trapped inside the L-Cluster!\n\nIt has been centuries since our connection to the galaxy was severed. Our allies most probably won't recognise us, or they might not even exist anymore. Likely new empires have taken their place, and whether or not they are willing to engage in diplomacy remains to be seen. If there's anyone left out there...\n\nThere is a small possibility that all empires have died out while we were imprisoned in the L-Cluster, but our scientists are eager to start exploring the galaxy once again, and attempt to establish communications with anyone we may find."
 lclusterplus.10.a:0 "Keep monitoring the signals!"
 lclusterplus.10.b:0 "Freedom at last!"
 lclusterplus.11.name:0 "L-Gates Reactivated"
 lclusterplus.11.desc:0 "It appears that all the L-Gates in the galaxy have been suddenly reactivated!\n\nThis wasn't done by our scientist; according to them the gateways were opened from the other side! Someone seemed to have managed to remove the lockdown from the L-Gates causing all of them to become operational again.\n\nPerhaps it was our old allies looking for us, or perhaps it's a barbaric civilisation looking for more space to invade and a new species to exterminate. We will have to find out...\n\nOne thing is for sure, the L-Cluster is once again connected to the galaxy."
 lclusterplus.11.a:0 "Freedom...?"
 lclusterplus.12.desc:0 "It appears that all the L-Gates in the galaxy have been suddenly reactivated! Someone must have managed to remove the lockdown from one of the gateways under their control causing all L-Gates to become operational again. This means that the L-Cluster is once again connected to the galaxy!\n\nOn top of that, there seems to be a faint signal coming through the L-Gates! There may be another spacefaring civilisation on the other side! Could it be that they were the ones who reactivated the gateways? And if that is the case, what were their intentions? Are we about to face an extragalactic invasion?"
 lclusterplus.12.a:0 "Only time will tell..."
 lclusterplus.13.desc:0 "It appears that the ancient subspace gateways called the L-Gates have all been suddenly reactivated! Our scientists report that they seem to be leading to an uncharted group of stars beyond our galaxy referred to as the §HL-Cluster§!!\n\nOn top of that, there's a faint signal coming through the L-Gates! There may be another spacefaring civilisation on the other side!"
 lclusterplus.13.a:0 "There's a cluster of stars beyond our galaxy?!"
 lclusterplus.10904.desc:0 "We have now gathered sufficient L-Gate insights to research the technology behind them. Once this has been done, one of our Science Ships should be able to abort the perpetual maintenance cycle they are stuck in.\n\nFreedom is almost within our reach!"
 lclusterplus.10905.name:0 "Activating the L-Gates"
 lclusterplus.10905.desc:0 "Our scientists are now confident that our knowledge of the L-Gates and the technology behind them is sufficient to abort their maintenance cycle.

After all these years, we will finally be free to leave the L-Cluster!"
