trait_superior_adaptation:0 "Superior Adaptation"
trait_superior_adaptation_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "The hives adaptability is especially remarkable. It not only knows how to perfectly modify all of its drones according to the local climate, but also to whatever task they are assigned to. I have never seen the mastery of the genome perfected in such a way.""
trait_maximum_food_yield:0 "Maximum Food Yield"
trait_maximum_food_yield_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "...but decades of breeding and genetic engineering have completely changed this species. Growth has been enhanced in the right areas to get as much meat from harvesting as possible, making them the hives primary food source. This has the minor side effect of decreased growth of brain matter, making this species dumb and docile. They don't even seem to realize that they are food for another species. I have studied cavemen that are smarter than these guys.""
trait_tasty_smartipants:0 "Smart Food"
trait_tasty_smartipants_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "This species intelligence and awareness has been intentionally increased by great magnitudes. They fully realize, that they are condemned to forever serve as quick, delicious snacks for the despicable and gross drones of a hivemind multitudes more intelligent than they are. I believe that this feeling of utter hopelessness and despair gives them a very delicious taste, making them a delicacy for the hive, although there is another possibility as well. They might be the last remains of a once great adversary of the hive, punished for what they have done to it. Although I don't believe this is very likely, given the generally practical thinking nature of hiveminds. Where they supposedly...""
trait_tasty_psionics:0 "Shroudy Aftertaste"
trait_tasty_psionics_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "... it appears that this species posses weak psionic capabilities, although tests have shown them to never fully manifest in individuals. The hive probably made sure of that. Still, their loose connection to other dimensions gives them a very distinct, subtle aftertaste that the hive seems to appreciate. It's commonly used in a type of stew that is given to drones that are under a lot of strain and have to process a lot of orders at once. I believe, that the weak psionic abilities in this food species can enhance the connection between drones to some degree and...""
trait_tasty_nutritious:0 "Nutritious"
trait_tasty_nutritious_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "This species has been engineered to be extremely nutritious, containing a lot of fat, protein and a minimal amount of that pesky sugar and bones. Looks like the hive has created its own version of protein bars. They are commonly fed to drones that are under a lot of physical strain.""
trait_former_drones:0 "Former Drones"
trait_former_drones_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "Drones that break free from the overminds will are usually regarded as dangerous intruders immediately and subsequently removed. Should I ever manage to free some of them, they will certainly make for an interesting object for study. I can only speculate, but I think that some thought patterns will probably remain the same as before, resulting in very unique behavior."

#leader traits
leader_trait_feral_admiral:0 "Feral"
leader_trait_feral_admiral_desc:0 "The drone commanding this fleet is not thinking logical, but rather like a cornered, feral animal."
leader_trait_tony:0 "TN-3"
leader_trait_tony_desc:0 "This AI was created long, long ago with the mission to observe all organic live in the galaxy. After its more recent research on an ancient hivemind, it decided to join our empire for a while, until its directives force it continue its endless quest in another place."

#buildings
building_sleeper_capital:0 "Massive Hive Complex"
building_sleeper_capital_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "This place serves as the hives main base of operation on this planet. Coordination, organization, maintenance, rerouting of transmissions, the more complex thinking processes and many other important tasks are handled here. This structure of flesh and bone stretches many, many kilometers and can be seen even from space. Over the millenia, these places became increasingly more complicated and mistakes in its logic and structure appeared more frequently. This, amongst many other supposed factors, is probably one of the main reasons the hive has collapsed into the sorry state it is right now. Today, only small parts of it are actually used and many processes don't even serve any purpose anymore. A theory that I...""
building_drone_capital:0 "Separated Hive Complex"
building_drone_capital_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "I have found, that the drones living on this planet have been seperated from its hive long ago and were forced to largely organize and think for themselfs, creating very peculiar, unique structures in its population centers. They are effectivly a completely separate hive mind that is still serving the original hives will. They are however not reciving any orders anymore, meaning that they too have stagnated to doing almost nothing. Should the hive ever awake again, these "subhives" will surely be absorbed again.""
building_sleeper_foundry:0 "Advanced Foundary"
building_sleeper_foundry_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "The hiveminds industrial cores have been a very curious subject. These specialized buildings make maximum use of space and the drones working in them have been heavily gene modified to survive the extreme heat inside. Because of said heat, the nodes and tendrill-connections that are usually present in all of the hives buildings were removed by the hive. Instead, a heavy presence of coordinator drones ensures that everything works with perfect efficiency. Of course, ever since the collapse this efficiency has strongly declined, but I think it is still a marvelous feat of engineering and planning.""
building_sleeper_fortress:0 "Defensive Combs"

building_sleeper_rotting_warrens_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "Kilometer upon kilometer of massive hive structure is rotting away ever since the hiveminds collapse. Unused and without somebody to maintain them, these structures frequently experience cave-ins and decay. Occasionally some drones roam the now empty corridors, but they are a rare sight. Here is where I was able to do most of my research and find out much about the workings of the hivemind and concluded,...""
building_sleeper_restored_warrens:0 "Restored Warrens"
building_sleeper_restored_warrens_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "...Here is where I was able to do most of my research and find out much about the workings of the hivemind and concluded, that these structures, if ever restored, will be the backbone of the hives economy. As a result of centuries of adaptation and improvement, the use of space and specialization present in these parts of the hive are unprecedented in the galaxy. Not even the great hivemind itself, should it ever wake up, will be able to replicate this mastery of efficiency again any time soon.""
building_sleeper_seasoning_fabricator:0 "Seasoning Fabricator"
building_sleeper_seasoning_fabricator_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: "Although the hivemind mostly relies on livestock to feed its hordes of drones, it still requires plant produce. The cattle needs something to eat too, after all. It also appears, that the hive is growing some rather exotic plants from all over the galaxy to spice up its meals a little bit. These are..."
building_sleeper_livestock_pens:0 "Livestock Pens"
building_sleeper_livestock_pens_desc:0 "An excerpt from the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded" reads the following: ...meaning that livestock has become a very important resource for the hivemind. Not only that, but experimenting with different species flavors has become a hobby of sorts for the hivemind. Many different species, all differently bred and genetically engineered are penned in in these facilities, always monitored by patrol drones. I tried to get some of them out for experimentation, but the hivemind seems very protective of its livestock. Videos of these facilities were one of the main unifing factors for the UIA. It further look like..."

Only loosely bound to its will, these drones roam around the massive hive complexes seemingly without purpose or goal, similar to a phenomenon observed in single minded organics, called "sleepwalking". I have even observed some of them breaking free completely, only to be killed immediately by the surrounding drones, since they then become a dangerous intruder to the hive. I have yet to...""

sleeper.deal.no:0 "Another time perhaps."
sleeper.12.desc:0 "Certainly. If you set the communications on your ships to constantly send a certain radio frequency, it will persuade the drones that you are one of them. Sadly, this only works with the hive itself, not the sub-hives around it, as these are still conscious enough to notice the difference. It does of course stop working if you choose to attack it anyway. For only a couple of credits I will provide the frequency to you."

sleeper.32.desc:0 "There is not much to tell. As the hives will grew weaker, some parts of its empire formed their own, smaller hiveminds. They are still loyal to the original mind, so they settled very close to it, awaiting its return. You can look it up in my encyclopedia, if you are interested! Their planets might be of great value to you. You can savely take one or two of them, just know that too many aggressions might awaken the ancient hive. I can send you detailed survey information about the planets held by the sub-hives, if you want. For only a couple of credits, their yours."

sleeper.23.title:0 "The Encyclopedia of the singleminded"
sleeper.23.desc:0 "I have collected data on the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] and hiveminds on general for many decades now. All of my findings are accessible through this database, the "Encyclopedia of the singleminded". Feel free to browse as much as you want."
sleeper.23.a:0 "Brief history of the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName]"
sleeper.24.desc:0 "Where the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] originated exactly is unknown. All I know is that when it came to be, it found itself in a galaxy in crisis. A galactic war had broken out, most of its participants long gone now of course. Only very few of them still remain to this day I think, the ones you have come to call "fallen empires". This war was complete and utter chaos and there seemed to be no peace or victory in sight. A sort of equilibrium was established, where empires lost and gained without ever really growing. This is probably why the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] went under the radar for to long. Through well thought out conquest, destruction, infiltration and assimilation it climbed its way to the top and managed to break that equilibrium. It became so big, that it singlehandedly ended the intergalactic war, as the other empires grew wary of the threat the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] posed to all of them. All of them banded together to form a great alliance against this menace. A common danger unites even the bitterest of enemies, as they say. This alliance fought the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] for many centuries and there seemed to be no voirctory in sight. That was, until one day the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] seemingly gave up its fight. Without much resistance, it was pushed back, its ships not responding to hostilities anymore and its workers walking around disorganized in the once teeming industrial centers. Nobody was sure what exactly had happened, all they knew was that they were free to fight each other again. As quickly as it was formed, the federation was dissolved again. Nobody seemed to care enough to wipe the [event_target:the_sleeper.GetName] out completly, so its three core worlds and some disorganized "subhives" remain today."
sleeper.23.b:0 "The collapse"
sleeper.25.desc:0 "Not much is known about what caused the collapse. Some say it was caused by overextension, that it just couldn't stem the sheer amount of drones it had under its control. Others say it became old and something similar to a what non-hive organisms call "dementia" started plaguing it. There are even theories that the Federation was able to disrupt it through some type of manipulation. Whatever the cause was, the hivemind slowly lost control over its drones, although not completely. Its power over them was still strong enough to stop them from becoming independent, but to weak to give them any new orders. The drones that didn't work themself to death just stood there, doing nothing until they starved. One by one its planets got depopulated and taken over by the UIA or the revolting local livestock."
sleeper.23.c:0 "The subhives"
sleeper.26.desc:0 "During the collapse a handful of drones were able to attain some form of free will. They started forming groups, which are only loosely bound to its former overmind. Loyally waiting for its return, they settled some of the planets near the three core worlds and attack anybody who threatens them or their master."
sleeper.23.d:0 "Waking it up"
sleeper.27.desc:0 "There are two possible wakeup scenarios: If threatened enough, it may become "feral" and start attacking everything in its path. Disorganized and not thinking logically, it will pose much less of a threat than it otherwise would, but it would still be very dangerous. Conquering the subhives, attacking its fleets or outright invading its planets might not trigger such an awakening on their own, but multiple such aggressions could potentially wake it up. The other scenario is a "proper" awakening, where it would be returned to its former, extremely powerful state. I am not yet sure how this would come to be, but it is a definite possibility. A scary possibility, depending on who you ask."
sleeper.23.e:0 "Its planets"
sleeper.28.desc:0 "Two of the three core planets have long since become a very literal part of the hive, their very surfaces bending to its will, just like the drones. Only the planet known as "The Farms" has not become so, as the livestock on it is the hives main source of food."

I fear that it might be driven into a frenzy, if any empire even dares to step into its territories, with aggressive intent or not. Although I do not fully understand how the hivemind communicates, I do know that certain radio waves can have some minor influence on them. The patterns are always changing, so its very hard to keep up with it, but I recently aquired a certain pattern that could calm the hive a bit. I want you to set up a satellite powerful enough to influence its main worlds and prolong the arrival of this waiting catastrophe. You only have a one year timeframe until the chance vanishes, so I beg you to hurry. Anyway, I will pay you 100 energycredits now and another 900 later, if you succeed. What do you say?"
sleeper_tony.26.desc:0 "Great! I will send you the info immediately. I also want you to know that these radio waves must be very precise and that even slightly changing them WILL have harmful results. So please, do not alter them."

All individuals on the targeted planet will form a new collective consciousness, which will be a completely loyal subject to us. Shall we proceed with this research?"
