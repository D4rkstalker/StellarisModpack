 utopiaDRG.name: "A question of appearances"
 
 utopiaDRG.0001.desc: "With genetic modifications becoming more easy the population has started to not only improve themselves but also to shape their bodies according to various trends. If this continues our original form will become only one out of many. But it is still early enough to forbid overt outside modification to preserve it."
 utopiaDRG.0002.desc: "Flesh has become as malleable as clay and appearances can be changed on a whim. Soon our original form will be lost to history unless we enforce its conservation."
 utopiaDRG.0003.desc: "While we have come to accept cybernetic implants aliens might take offense in them. If that is a concern we could add synthetic scales to each implant which makes it all but invisible to the naked eye"
 utopiaDRG.0004.desc: "We are still exploring the possibilities psionics give us but it seems affecting the outside world becomes easier when we let psionic energy flow on our scales. While this is not harmful it tends to startle our nonpsionic members and alien races. We could add training classes to our psionic education program to achieve nearly the same power without any outward sign to deal with this issue."
 utopiaDRG.0005.desc: "Psionic energy flows through our bodies like blood and some scholars believe we will in the foreseeable future shed our physical forms altogether. Not everyone believes this to be desirable, so while the debates continue we can for now focus a small part of our thoughts on maintaining a full physical form"
