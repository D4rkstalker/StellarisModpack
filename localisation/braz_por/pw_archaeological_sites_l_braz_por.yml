    pw_site_drained_paradise: "Drained Paradise"
    pw_site_drained_paradise_desc: "Readings suggest that [From.Planet.GetName] was habitable at some point in its history. Not only that, the composition of the ground, orbital position and presence of water show that the planet could have had a thriving ecosystem, lush green fields, abundance of minerals and a paradisiacal atmosphere. What could have happened to deprive this planet of life?\n\nThere are many signals of ruined buildings also present in the surface, three of which draw the most attention because of their size and key position. Maybe they hold the secret of this planet's past."
    pw_archaeology.105.name: "Empty Cornucopia"
    pw_archaeology.105.desc: "The first of these grand ruins consist of an abandoned genetic laboratory isolated from other ruins. Surrounding soil readings suggest a great diversity of nutrients used to compose the ground here and points to a planet containing a myriad of environments that housed diverse plant, animal and fungi life. One of the better preserved walls of the building revel the drawing of a cornucopia, and it seems that this was food growing and collection center in a distant past. Further analysis shows that this was the epicenter of total ecological collapse of the planet's biosphere, due to predatory harvesting practices."
    pw_archaeology.110.name: "Exhausted Tower"
    pw_archaeology.110.desc: "The second ruined location appears to be a grand solar structure of some sort, that used to consist of a heliostat with several mirror arrays pointing to a central spire that converted the captured solar energy to another form, which we could not determine. The entire structure seem to have been able to float freely following the star's zenith to maximize energy intake, but has crashed a long time ago from lack of maintenance. In proximity to the crash site, our archeologists have found the control facility of this wonderful structure, which contains records telling how the original builders were able to manipulate the atmosphere of [From.Planet.GetName], to clear the clouds for the heliostat and exploit the rain in hydropower reservoirs. The constant seeding and voiding of clouds has shredded the atmosphere of the planet to the point of catastrophe."
    pw_archaeology.115.name: "Drained Rock"
    pw_archaeology.115.desc: "The third ruin is the entrance of a gigantic mining project that permeates the entire surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Old machinery and tools here indicate a massive scale prospecting and extraction enterprise of valuable minerals of many types and uses. Unfortunately, the archaeological team also found several reports of soil erosion and land degradation caused by this excavation, and evidence that those reports were solemnly ignored; the final nail on this planets coffin.\n\nAll is not lost, however, with the data we have collected from these sites, and the employment of our own technology and resources, the science team here is fairly confident that they can bring this planet back to its verdant glory, using the established infrastructure. First we must revert the erosion processes and bring nutrients back to the ground by utilizing our own minerals."
    pw_archaeology.115.a: "Use the minerals, start the renewal process."
    pw_archaeology.120.name: "A Ground to Walk Upon"
    pw_archaeology.120.desc: "By adapting some of the old digging machines of the mining project we could rebuild the soil components and mend the earth, bringing tectonic stability and mineral nutrition back to most of the surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Care was taken to retain some of these extracting facilities for future use, provided we do not drain the minerals from the planet once again. This paves the way to revitalizing the biosphere, but is only the first step.\n\nNow the science team gaze upwards, to the atmosphere, for we must use our energy to reestablish the original gasses and jump start the water cycle."
    pw_archaeology.125.name: "A Sky Over Our Heads"
    pw_archaeology.125.desc: "Utilizing the ancient cloud manipulation facility of the heliostat, the science tem in [From.Planet.GetName] was able to revert its damaging process and refill the atmosphere with gases that will help with the settlement of life in the planet. While not entirely breathable, the newly established atmosphere is already balancing the planet temperature, protecting the surface from space radiation and waiting to receive gas exchange from life forms.\n\nThe terraforming process is almost complete, now we only need to reintroduce a stable ecosystem to harmonious maintain the achieved planetary balance."
    pw_archaeology.125.a: "We will provide the nutrients to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.125.b: "We will provide the resources to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.130.name: "Life All Around"
    pw_archaeology.130.desc: "Using the provided resources and the facilities in the abandoned cornucopia the science team has manage to revitalize the broken biosphere of [From.Planet.GetName] and reignite the vital force there. By using recovered data, we could stabilize gas exchange and food chains much faster than natural phenomenons. Finally, our scientists could breath the fresh air of the planet for the first time.\n\n[From.Planet.GetName] now blossoms with new life and proper colonization of the planet can be underway. The only caveat is that the ecosystem of the planet - the soil, the atmosphere and the living organisms - are in an unstable balance and can never recover completely, thus the ancient structures that drained the planetary living energy cannot be rebuild, but they can still serve us as they are."
