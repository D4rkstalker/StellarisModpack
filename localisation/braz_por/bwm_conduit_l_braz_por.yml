Although the construction will require the aid of a construction ship at the new shipyard, these designs seem to surpass those used by fallen empires in terms of lethality.\n\nThe other design is a bit more unusual, it appears to be a matter converter of some sort, but much more efficient than anything we have ever conceptualized ourselves.
