 bwm_gravekeeper.1:0 "The Graveyard"
 bwm_gravekeeper.1.desc:0 "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our ships are greeted by the sight of several large derelict spaceships. They are surrounded by an ominous "space grave" of thousands of deceased life forms. In the middle of the debris field is what appears to be a space station that looks relatively intact."
 bwm_gravekeeper.1.a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 bwm_gravekeeper.2:0 "The Gravekeeper"
 bwm_gravekeeper.2.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] managed to gain access to what appears to be the central mainframe of the orbital installation. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] believes they might be able to breach the station's security protocols, reactivating the facility."
 bwm_gravekeeper.2.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"
 bwm_gravekeeper.2.a.tooltip:0 "Reactivate the space station orbiting [bwm_grave_star.GetName]."
 bwm_gravekeeper.2.b:0 "Subverting the security of such advanced technology is unwise."
 
 bwm_gravekeeper.10:0 "Murphy's Fallacy" 
 bwm_gravekeeper.10.desc:0 "The activation was a success! The security protocols have been bypassed, and the facility is fully powered and operational. A permanent crew has been garrisoned on the station. Once they have replaced the disabled security systems with our own protocols and established standard engineering control systems we should have full control over the station." 
 bwm_gravekeeper.10.a:0 "This shouldn't take more than a few days."

 bwm_gravekeeper.21:0 "Awakening"
 bwm_gravekeeper.21.desc:0 "After taking a fierce pounding, the alien station in the [bwm_grave_system.GetName] system finally loses power and for a brief, joyous moment appears neutralised. The victory is shortlived, as power is restored moments later and the space station quickly reconfigures itself before resuming combat. Clearly there is more here than meets the eye."

 bwm_gravekeeper.31:0 "From the Ashes" 
 bwm_gravekeeper.31.desc:0 "Our weaponry appears to be ineffective against the target. Given our losses, several strategists suggest dedicating scientific resources to devising a way to penetrate the enemies defenses." 
 bwm_gravekeeper.31.a:0 "We aren't so easily beaten." 
 bwm_gravekeeper.31.b:0 "Our military has no need for this."
 
 bwm_gravekeeper.32:0 "Last Rites"

 bwm_gravekeeper.41.desc:0 "We have managed to disable the weapon in the [bwm_grave_system.GetName] system. Despite the extensive damage it took from our fleet it appears to still possess the ability to repair. Although it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that if we act with haste its systems can be modified for use with our own fleets. It would certainly make for a powerful tactical asset."
 bwm_gravekeeper.41.a:0 "It will make a powerful addition to the fleet."
 bwm_gravekeeper.41.b:0 "This "thing" is far too dangerous, take it apart!"
 
 bwm_gravekeeper.43:0 "Gravekeeper Captured"
 bwm_gravekeeper.43.desc:0 "Reports are coming in that an alien empire has captured the ancient warship designated as the 'Gravekeeper' in the [bwm_grave_system.GetName] system."
 
 bwm_gravekeeper.50:0 "From the Grave"
 bwm_gravekeeper.50.desc:0 "This is a glorious day! Our engineers have finished their work on the weapon we fought in the [bwm_grave_system.GetName] system and it has passed all safety tests. While our more cautious engineers hesitate to declare this mysterious technological behemoth to be truly reliable, they agree that it is as safe as any ancient weapon can be. The AI core has been replaced with a new system of our own design, and we are awaiting instruction."
 bwm_gravekeeper.50.a:0 "Will we ever know what really happened in that graveyard system?"

 bwm_gravekeeper.72:0 "Overdrive" 
 bwm_gravekeeper.72.desc:0 "Our scientists have finished their adjustments to the reactor core of the Gravekeeper; for a short time it should now be possible to go beyond the ships normal limits."

 bwm_gravekeeper.77.desc:0 "Though we have been able to partially unlock the power of this ancient ship we are yet far from fully understanding how it works in its entirety, not to mention reproducing its technological marvels and applying it to our own designs.\n\nOur scientists have made many breakthroughs since the discovery of the ship yet progress is made slowly. Their latest proposal to gain deeper understanding involves a thorough study of the ships framework and its numerous inner processes. It is needless to say that while these studies are in progress it would greatly hamper the ships overall performance, which might pose a significant reduction of our empires naval capabilites.\n\nIn the name of progress our scientists may blindly accept many risks but on the other hand should we risk to omit this opportunity?"
 bwm_gravekeeper.77.a:0 "We will take this opportunity."
 bwm_gravekeeper.77.a.tooltip:0 "§RWARNING - The ship will be vulnerable for the duration of this project.§!"
 bwm_gravekeeper.77.b:0 "We can not afford to lose this ship, denied."
 
 bwm_gravekeeper.78:0 "Schematics - Gravekeeper"
 bwm_gravekeeper.78.desc:0 "As our scientists have finished their examination of the ship some of its mysteries have been lifted while others still elude us, nonetheless it was a success.\n\nWhile we are not yet able to apply its technology to our own designs our scientists and engineers feel confident enough to reconstruct this ship, even if we had to replace whole components in case of its destruction.\n\nWith the project's completion the ship's performance has been fully restored and the newly aquired knowledge may lead to formerly unimagined technological advances that will surely give our empire an edge in the wars to come."
