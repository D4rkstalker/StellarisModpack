 ag_alpha.25.desc:0 "By analyzing previous records obtained from Ancient Titan: Light of Lonely Star, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] believes that in the time of the ancient civilization, there existed some kind of large-scale psionic structures near the §H[ag_ancient_alpha_star.GetName]§!, possibly used as a weapon in the late stages of the ancient civilization - some kind of psionic weapon on a star system scale.\n\nOur [Root.GetScienceTeam] thinks this may have some connection to the history of the §H[ag_ancient_alpha_star.GetName]§!, observations by the [Root.GetAstronomyDepartment] show that the psionic activity patterns of that giant psionic structure still exist in modern galaxies In the psionic environment of , this means that it or a part of it has survived to the present, providing a valuable opportunity for our archaeological work, but first we need to find a way to locate this coordinate."
