PROJECT_ALL_ORIGIN_TECH_DESC: "We will accept the gifts of the Stell'dorei, rise up to become their chosen champion within this galaxy. We will fufill our destiny and joins the Second Order of Light. For the Stellarbornes! For the [root.GetName]!"

PROJECT_LIGHT_MATTER: "Lesson 1 : The Light"
PROJECT_LIGHT_MATTER_DESC: "The Stellarborne has allowed us to study and practice the manipulation of Static Light. The First lesson is to study the nature of how the power works, within the concepts of this galaxy's understanding and scope. It will take a considerable amounts of time to perfect it, but we are confident that we should be able to understand things clearer soon."

PROJECT_OFFENSE_ORIGIN_TECH: "Lesson 2 : Ways of the Water"
PROJECT_OFFENSE_ORIGIN_TECH_DESC: "The next lesson, is to understand how the Light "flows". Although the Static Light is merely a toned-down version of the power that goes beyond infinity, its concept is similar. The term "water" in this case. does not reflect what we understand of water, rather it refers to the nature of the abstract waves that are found across Arya, the realms where the Stellarbornes were forged. The realms are composed of an endless sky, and a depthless ocean that spans across the entire realm. The oceans resonate powerful energies and constant, relentless waves surge across every directions. These waves will sweep and devastate anything that fails to adapt to its merciless nature.\n\nWith enough understanding and practice, Static Light can be shaped into powerful weapons based upon the same concepts as these deadly waves. Learn not how to strike with puny, ineffective water, but to focus into relentless tsunami and typhoon that will sweep aside even the sturdiest metal.\n\nBecome one with the wave, become the storm that cannot be subsided; an Unstoppable Force. Unleash your fury, awakening from within your burning hearts."

PROJECT_DEFENSE_ORIGIN_TECH: "Lesson 3 : Ways of the Stone"
PROJECT_DEFENSE_ORIGIN_TECH_DESC: "The next lesson, is to understand how the Light "maintains". Although the Static Light is merely a toned-down version of the power that goes beyond infinity, its concept is similar. The Ways of the Stone, refers to the nature of how various constructs within the Homeworld of Arya, both natural and artificial, reacts and resists against the relentless waves of tidal waters. These living obelisks are able to sense dangers of approaching impacts, and subconsciously reponds by creating perfect counter-waves, sending the waves up into the skies. Indeed Arya is a strange and dangerous place for the untrained, for the waves will come from every directions, every angles. To survive, one must hone their minds and skills, develop techniques that will ward off against any attacks. An attack of this kind is ineffective against those who simply deny its existences. Any organisms within Arya, including the Stelalrbornes mastered these techniques.\n\nWith enough training, we can also learn to awaken our sub-consciousness, and deflects against any attcks by denying their causes and effects; an Unmovable Object. Resolution, Determination, Awareness. Master these into instincts, and all attacks will be nulled."
PROJECT_DEFENSE_ORIGIN_TECH_EXPLAIN: "This will unlock various weapon components that have Medium slots or below, including point defenses and fighters. Will also unlock shields, armors and associated auxes."

PROJECT_UTILITY_ORIGIN_TECH: "Lesson 4 : Ways of the Wind"
PROJECT_UTILITY_ORIGIN_TECH_DESC: " The next lesson, is to understand how the Light "expands". Although the Static Light is merely a toned-down version of the power that goes beyond infinity, its concept is similar. Those that walks the middle path, between the merciless waves of force and dauntless obelisks of Arya must be able to become like the wind. Sweep away the waters, shift through the stones. Let no obstacles obstruct your paths. Use the wind as currents that will carry you throughout the journey.\n\nOnce mastered, you will be able to channel Static Light to respond to your commands, to go further and further beyond into the stars. To understand how to stand in the middle, to see through the reflections of time and space."
