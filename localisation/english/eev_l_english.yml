The object appears to be placed by an ancient civilization, roughly 3000 years ago. In their culture, placing flags on celestial objects was a way to claim areas in space. \n\nSince there is little to no wind on §Y[From.GetName]§!, the flag has not eroded over the past 3000 years. What happened to the ancient civilization is still a mystery. "

Regardless, Science Officer §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has begun to artificially unfreezing the planet. \n\nWhile the planet was being thawed a facility was constructed to study them going back to their pre-frozen lives. It took a few days before their bodies completely thawed. Sadly, only a few hundred of them survived the process. \n\nSome of our scientists were caught off guard by the creatures once they awakened. Luckily, security measures were taken to prevent some of them from going on a rampage. They were put on anesthetics and a small transport ship carried them to what to us seems like an important landmark. \n\nOnce they fully awakened from the anesthetics they seemed very confused. A few of them started to attack, but one of them rose up and convinced them to calm down. The crew was fascinated by the primitive creatures."

 star_stuff.4.name: "An F-Type Star"

 star_stuff.5.name: "A G-Type Star"
 star_stuff.5.desc: "This yellow dwarf is known as a G-Type star. These stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. \n\nAlthough the G-Type star's lifespan is shorter than a K-Type star, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G-Type star enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 star_stuff.5.a: "Amazing."
 
 star_stuff.6.name: "A K-Type Star"

 star_stuff.7.name: "An M-Type Star"
 star_stuff.7.desc: "M-Type stars are among the most common in the universe and are often referred to as Red Dwarf stars.

 star_stuff.8.name: "A Neutron Star"
 star_stuff.8.desc: "This incredibly dense star is known as a Neutron Star and is often created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. \n\nAlthough their diameter is as a little as ten kilometers their mass is even greater than an average G-Type star!"
 star_stuff.8.a: "Incredible!"
 
 star_stuff.9.name: "A Black Hole"
 star_stuff.9.desc: "This is known as a Black Hole and is formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle. \n\nBlack Holes have an extremely strong gravitational field that prevent anything - even light - from escaping once it enters the event horizon. \n\nThe crew had to be very careful when studying this monster of a star."
 star_stuff.9.a: "Amazing!"
 
 star_stuff.10.name: "A Pulsar"
 star_stuff.10.desc: "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. \n\nA Pulsar is only visible when the radiation beam is pointing directly at the observer which result in a very precise interval of pulses that can sometimes be so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy."
 star_stuff.10.a: "Incredible!"
 
 star_stuff.11.name: "Studies Complete"
 star_stuff.11.desc: "After all these years we have completed our studies of all known star types in the universe. It was a bumpy ride but there's no doubt in anyone's mind that nothing but good can come of this! \n\nOur lead scientist suggests that keeping a close eye on these stars would be best, but did mention something about using the knowlege we have learned to gather more energy..."
 star_stuff.11.a: "We now know more about the universe."
 star_stuff.11.b: "Energy it is!"
 
 star_stuff_chain_title: "The Star Search Project"
 star_stuff_chain_desc: "Since our people came to be we have always been looking up in awe at the stars. Now we can actually visit them. \n\nAll of our scientists agree that we should gather information on all the different types of stars to see what secrets they hold."
