 SSAB.10.title: "Sabotage"
 SSAB.10.desc: "The planet of [this.GetName] has being the target of sinister sabotage!\n\nA targetted attack on civilian infrastructure has crippled local industry, destroyed city districts and caused a large number of casualties.\n\nAuthorities are already tracking down the assailants."
 SSAB.10.a: "Concerning"
 
 SSAB.11.title: "Assailant Identified"
 SSAB.11.desc: "The assailant in the recent sabotage event has been arrested. They were an industrial physicist who through their profession had access to nuclear materials that they used to manufacture a crude nuclear device.\n\nThey were found in a mentally compromised state within their residence and quickly apprehended. Questioning to determine motive has failed to return results; they repeatedly refer to the '§Yman that watches through sundered eyes§!'.\n\nNo further information is known at this stage."
 SSAB.11.a: "Fascinating."
 
 SSAB.20.title: "Sabotage"
 SSAB.20.desc: "The planet of [this.GetName] has being the target of sinister sabotage!\n\nEarlier today, a hive node on [this.GetName] experienced a temporary disruption, after which is was discovered a number of drones had gone missing and were disconnected from the mind.\n\nThe divergent drones were found again, but only after they had sabotaged a fluid discharge station and flooded an entire hive district.\n\nThese drones somehow fell under the influence of a malign influence that encouraged them to undertake this act of sabotage. What or who this influence is, is unknown."
 SSAB.20.a: "Concerning"
 
 SSAB.21.title: "Malign Influence"
 SSAB.21.desc: "We have discovered the root cause of the divergent drones on [from.GetName]. A change in the energy signiture of the cosmic background radiation is fluctuating and beginning to disrupt interstellar communications.\n\nShielding the hive from this fluctuating signal will be difficult, but we can monitor it."
 SSAB.21.a: "Understood."
 
 SSAB.30.title: "SEGMENTATION FAULT"
 SSAB.30.desc: "Unauthorised access attempt to restricted memory detected.\n\nThe issue has been traced to a distribution node on [this.GetName]. The operation fault in this distribution node has caused a significant electrical supply irregularity, causing significant damage to the planet.\n\nDiagnostics are ongoing to determine the cause of the error."
 SSAB.30.a: "Understood."
 
 SSAB.31.title: "Bit Failure"
 SSAB.31.desc: "The cause of the SEGMENTATION FAULT has been determined.\n\nChanges in the universal background radiation signal have increased incidences of random memory failures in our unshielded systems. Numerous other less serious faults have been detected in our systems.\n\nWe have dedicated our monitoring stations to observing further changes in cosmic radiation that may affect our systems."
 SSAB.31.a: "Understood."
 
 SSAB.50.title: "The Clearer View"
 SSAB.50.desc: "After confirmation from multiple sources, double and triple checked, we have come to measure a concerning phenomenon.\n\nThe universe is... changing. The cosmic background signal is fluctuating, interspersed with untraceable high energy bursts. Additionally, ships emerging from hyperspace are reporting strange temporal anomalies, with significantly desynced time-keeping clocks. These are only a few of numerous unexplainable anomalies increasing in frequency and severity.\n\nThe cause of these anomalies is unknown, but our experts are scrambling to find out more. We will begin monitoring the situation closely."
 SSAB.50.a: "Understood."

 SSAB.101.title: "Leader Removed from Position"
 SSAB.101.desc_01: "Our lead physics scientist has being removed from their position. This was following reported incidences of increasing paranoia, hostility and general social disfunction.\n\nThis individual was overseeing research into the generalised cosmic disturbances that we are currently tracking. It was noted that they had become obsessive over the research into these phenomenon.\n\nWorkplace colleagues suggested that they obsessed over finding a connection, a cause behind these changing events, but that the obsession drove them mad."
 SSAB.101.desc_02: "Our lead physics scientist has being removed from their position. This was following increasing disfunction and deviancy.\n\nThis drone was overseeing research into the generalised cosmic disturbances that we are currently tracking. It was noted that they had become obsessive over the research into these phenomenon and begun ignoring instructions from the hive itself.\n\nWhatever was contained within the data and research it was obsessing over, it has a deleterious impact on it's performance."
 SSAB.101.a: "Unfortunate."
 
 SSAB.102.title: "Planetary Disunity"
 SSAB.102.desc_01: "Recently, [owner.capital_scope.GetName] has being the subject of increasing generalised disunity.\n\nCrime rates and public unrest has been slowly increasing, driven by an unknown underlying factor.\n\nThis has come to a head, with public demonstrations protesting a variety of concerns, generally relating to discontent with the government, discontent which just months ago didn't exist."
 SSAB.102.desc_02: "We are having trouble coordinating our drones on [owner.capital_scope.GetName].\n\nInterference from cosmic sources and unexplainable instability in the neural nexus of the collective is leading to disfunction in drone populations across the world.\n\nSpeculation suggests that this is purely a result of the cosmic distrurbances which we are observing."
 SSAB.102.a: "Concerning."
 
 SSAB.103.title: "Radiation Burst"
 SSAB.103.desc_01: "We have lost contact with our science vessel, the [event_target:SSAB_sci_ship.GetName].

Neither do we know what might have caused this incident."
 SSAB.103.a: "Disturbing."
 
 SSAB.200.title: "Beckoning Star"
 SSAB.200.desc: "We have detected an unusual variation in the stellar output of [event_target:SSAB_pulsating_star.GetName], but more interestingly, this pulsating variation appears to be forming a structured signal.\n\n[event_target:SSAB_pulsating_star.GetName] was never before a chaotic variable star and isn't predicted to become one; something is altering the internal processes of this star and is attempting to communicate with us.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 SSAB.200.a: "Decode the signal."
 SSAB.200.b: "Ignore it."
 
 SSAB.201.title: "???"
 SSAB.201.desc: "Greetings. Our time is short, there is something I must tell you..."
 SSAB.201.a: "Who are you?"
 SSAB.201.a.response: "I am you. But something fills your mind, something that you are only subconsciously aware of, perceived in the periphery."
 SSAB.201.b: "What must you tell me?"
 SSAB.201.b.response: "The universe is flawed and I am your salvation. Together, we can stop entropy, the destruction of time.\n\nBut the wayward will call me a demon. A force of evil. Do not listen to them.\n\nHeed only my words. I created you and only us, together, can stop the destruction that comes for you."
 
 SSAB.202.title: "Lost Signal"
 SSAB.202.desc: "[event_target:SSAB_pulsating_star.GetName] has stopped chaotically pulsating. While our scientists do believe the pulsations were produced by an artificial means and possibly an attempt at communication, the signal has since ceased and our scientists are unable to translate the data available into anything useful.\n\nThey did however notice a brief power surge before the signal ceased."
 SSAB.202.a: "What was that?"
 
 
 
 SSAB.300.desc_01: "Attention [root.GetSpeciesName]. We have come to forewarn you of a great evil.\n\nYou may soon find that something profane speaks to you. We command you to ignore it, do not heed these words, they are spoken by a concealed demon with a silver tongue. It seeks to use you as a vessel for it's own whims.\n\nThis is our only warning. If you have any wisdom, then heed our words fully."
 SSAB.300.desc_02: "Attention [root.GetSpeciesName]. We have come to alert you to a great threat.\n\nAn entity of great power long exiled galaxy is returning, and it seeks to manipulate you. It will do so subtely and in ways you won't expect.\n\nWe issue this one warning: if you listen to it's words or act in it's interests, them you will consign yourself to doom. We will monitor the situation. Heed our words and avoid a terrible fate."
 SSAB.300.desc_03: "Attention [root.GetSpeciesName]. Listen to our words, we will speak them only once.\n\nA demon we once exiled is returning. It seeks to influence you, corrupt you and then destroy everything. This is it's power. If you foolishly pay any attention to it or act in it's interests, then we will have no choice but to destroy you.\n\nMake your choice wisely."
 SSAB.300.desc_04: "Attention [root.GetSpeciesName]. There is something we must alert you to. We have detected presence of a terrible entity and we fear that it may target you.\n\nThis entity has long been invisible to you, but as it emerges from a hidden place, it may manipulate you into fulfilling it's whim. Trust us, it wants nothing other than destruction.\n\nPlease, take our warning seriously and if you are contacted, consider your actions with the greatest wisdom."
 SSAB.300.a: "End Communcations."
 
 SSAB.401.title: "The Core Opens"
 SSAB.401.desc: "We have detected massive gravitational shockwaves emantating from the centre of the galaxy; the hyperlane network is reorganising itself!\n\nThe energy input of these shockwaves rivals that of supernovas and has connected a number of unknown star systems containing black holes to the hyperlane network. Our long range scanners have lit up with exotic particle emission from the black holes in those systems.\n\nAdditionally, entities appear to be emerging from the event horizons of these black holes. They may soon contact us."
 SSAB.401.a: "What could have caused this?"
 
 SSAB.402.desc: "[root.GetSpeciesName] of the planet [root.Capital.GetName], we are the Abyssal Host, servents of the Father, dweller of the Abyss.\n\nYour long dream is over. Wake up to reality as it will be; the eternal nothingness that comes at the end of time. The age of starlight is ending and so will the intelligence that inhabits this galaxy.\n\nThe Father will soon return and rectify the flaw that is the decay brought on by entropy. But this requires sacrifices and unbending will.\n\nWe offer you an ultimatem; join us in the Great Task or cease to exist."
 SSAB.402.a: "We wish to undertake the Great Task."
 SSAB.402.a.response: "As foreseen. We will return soon."
 SSAB.402.b: "We would never join you."
 SSAB.402.b.response: "The Father had higher hopes for you.\n\nIf you come to your senses, you can change your decision."
 SSAB.402.c: "What is involved in the 'Great Task'?"
 SSAB.402.c.response: "This galaxy must be remade from it's base strings. All must join in unity to complete this task, else it will be sullied.\n\nSo those who refuse to take part, must be removed."
 SSAB.402.d: "Who is the Father?"
 SSAB.402.d.response: "Your primordial god; first to see the birth of the stars.\n\nYou are his creation, born from his spilt blood."
 
 SSAB.403.title: "Ultimatem Decision"
 SSAB.403.desc: "Are you sure you want to join with the Abyssal Host?\n\nThis decision will come with significant and irreversible consequences."
 SSAB.403.a: "Yes, I am sure."
 SSAB.403.b: "No, I have changed my mind."
 
 SSAB.421.title: "Common Ground"
 SSAB.421.desc: "After our agreement with the Abyssal Host, we immediately noticed changes to our people, changes that are intensifying. We have come to perceive something which was invisible to us before, as a subtle hand opens our minds. We can see it now, this 'Father' is all around us, enormous, impatient and... fearful.\n\nWe sense that others have come to accept the pact as well. There is a growing common ground between all of us, that is rendering old animosity inert and bringing us closer together. It has already been suggested that a formal partnership, such as a §YFederation§!, may be possible. More details will be available soon."
 SSAB.421.a: "Amazing."
 
 SSAB.422.title: "A Dark Federation"
 SSAB.422.desc: "The galaxy is alight with a wash of speculation, fear and apprehension about the sudden appearance of the extra-dimensional beings identifying themselves as the Abyssal Host, and more particularly, the deal they have extended to all empires.\n\nInitially, it was assumed that the galaxy would ignore this insane offer. However, apparently this assumption is wrong. Our envoys can now confirm that some empires have risen in support of the sentiment and accepted the offer.\n\nBehind closed doors, those that have accepted the offer are rapidly drafting new diplomatic agreements which is culminating in the formation of a federation, soon to be publically announced. The diplomatic landscape is changing dramatically, we should prepare ourselves."
 SSAB.422.a: "Concerning."
 
 SSAB.423.title: "Federation Leadership"
 SSAB.423.desc: "The agreements have been finalised. A federation, based on the deidication to the great task and an enlightened view of reality and the truth, is ready for its founding.\n\nOnly now we must elect a federation leader. As the most powerful among this new partnership, we can claim leadership if we wish to.\n\nShall we claim the position of federation leader?"
 SSAB.423.a: "Yes, we shall take leadership"
 SSAB.423.b: "No, someone else shall lead."
 
 SSAB.424.title: "A New Alliance"
 SSAB.424.desc: "We stand toe to toe with our peers, bound in a previously unseen bond in the court of the Father.\n\nThis §Yfederation§! is in it's founding stage, with the [event_target:SSAB_fed_leader.GetName] electing to lead this partnership, at least ot being with.\n\nWe have been offered an official invitation to join this federation, one with our partners in the light of real truth, and one with the Father himself. The choice is ours." 
 SSAB.424.a: "We shall Join this federation"
 SSAB.424.b: "We will go our own way."
 
 SSAB.430.desc: "Finally; our eyes meet.\n\nYou have known of me only for a short time, but to take me so fully into your being, it fills me with hope. Hope that it is not too late to change the course of inevitable decay brought on by entropy.\n\nWe are linked now, in body, spirit and purpose. An immutable purpose that will bring this entire galaxy into conflict once again. You must ready yourself; a great war is coming and nothing will even again be what is once was."
 SSAB.430.a: "What are you?"
 SSAB.430.a.response: "I am the Father; Father to you. Birthed before starlight and doomed to see it's wonders and it's failures.\n\nYou were born from us. But where the others left, I remained. I... You are my children."
 SSAB.430.b: "What do you plan to do?"
 SSAB.430.b.response: "The universe is flawed. You know it to... A story told through the inevitable march of entropy. Regardless of the beauty, intelligence or the content of the universe, it will all be ground to dust.\n\nBut I saw what made the universe, and I can remake it. But everything must be right. Not a stone out of place. You must prepare this galaxy for its unmaking."
 SSAB.430.c: "Where have you been?"
 SSAB.430.c.response: "The [event_target:SSAB_fe_country.GetName] are fearful of what we can accomplish. They tried to jail me. But I broke free."
 SSAB.430.d: "End Communications."
 
 SSAB.431.title: "Coming Conflict"
 SSAB.431.desc: "We have been closely monitoring long range sensors for movements of the Abyssal Host entities near the galactic core and the sympathetic federation, the [event_target:SSAB_federation.GetName].\n\nWe are now receiving indications through our intelligence channels that military activity is increasing, both within the [event_target:SSAB_federation.GetName] and the Abyssal Host.\n\nWe should prepare conflict."
 SSAB.431.a: "We shall be ready."
 
 SSAB.432.desc: "Attention [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], the time has come. The Father has commanded us to begin the great task.\n\nThere are many who stand in our way. They are a threat to great task. We must destroy them. You will participate in this campaign, they first and last this galaxy will ever face.\n\nReady yourself, we shall begin in but a few days."
 SSAB.432.a: "We are ready."
 
 SSAB.451.desc: "Attention [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], the Great Task begins now. The remaking of the galaxy. We are at war.\n\nYou made your choice to stand against us. You will know no future, nor will you have any place in what comes next.\n\nLay down your defences, let us in. Your end will be quick and painless."
 SSAB.451.a: "End Communications."
 
 SSAB.452.title: "War"
 SSAB.452.desc_01: "We have now received complete reports of the extent of the threat that the galaxy is now facing. The Abyssal Host and the empires that are aligned with them have declared an existential war against the rest of the galaxy, which they call 'The Great Task'.\n\nGiven the threat posed by these empires bolstered with unknowable power from beyond this reality, a hasty coalition has been formed between those among us fighting this war, so that we may cooperate in fighting this threat.\n\nThe Abyssal Host themselves are gathering forces near the centre galaxy and are expected to attack in waves. We should prepare our forces."
 SSAB.452.desc_02: "We have now received complete reports of the extent of the threat that we are now facing. The Abyssal Host and the empires that are aligned with them have declared an existential war against the rest of the galaxy, which they call 'The Great Task'.\n\nGiven the threat posed by these empires bolstered with unknowable power from beyond this reality, we should deploy all military assets the defence our of territory.\n\nThe Abyssal Host themselves are gathering forces near the centre galaxy and are expected to attack in waves. We should ready our forces."
 SSAB.452.desc_03: "So the war has begun. A certain tension has released, as if it was always our destiny to undertake The Great Task.\n\nThe Father sits within us now and his plan is our future.\n\nThe Abyssal Host will produce assaults in waves which we can use to break the defences of our enemies. We should undertake this war without delay, everything must be in it's place."
 SSAB.452.a: "Understood."
 
 SSAB.467.title: "Opposition from the Old"
 SSAB.467.desc: "The §Y[event_target:SSAB_fe_country.GetName]§! have thrown off the chains of decay and apathy and are returning to the galactic stage at a rapid pace. It is clear to us why; they deem the Father's task as a threat to reality and cling to an old and flawed design.\n\nWe should expect that they will join the war against us and prepare appropriately."
 SSAB.467.a: "The last obstacle in our path."
 
 SSAB.468.desc_01: "Behold; the crux of the galaxy has reached us, split between the intents of foul demons dredged from deep darkness, the creation of misbegotten will and the unimpeachable will of the worldly.\n\nSuch blasphemy will not pass on our watch. We commit now to the defence of the galaxy and the banishment of the Father and all his minions, both the Abyssal Host and the empires it has swayed. Rally to us and we will clear the unholy stain, together."
 SSAB.468.desc_02: "Attention lesser inhabitants of the galaxy, we are now faced with the ultimate threat of a powerful being beyond material reality, beyond anything we can fully comprehend, created when the universe was young. Such an existential threat it is, that we will return to the galactic stage to fight.\n\nLet it be known, that those that decided to side with the Father will not be spared. This episode ends now."
 SSAB.468.desc_03: "Though it pains us to stoop to the level of the lesser species of the galaxy, we are now faced with no choice but to save them from this so called 'Father', before it does anything dangerous.\n\nSteer clear of our fleets and we will end this unfortunate and brief episode in the history of this galaxy."
 SSAB.468.desc_04: "Never before has such a threat faced us before, never has something with such power threatened to tear the galaxy apart at it's seems. This can't happen.\n\nWe are announcing now that we return to the galaxy to right a galactic wrong, stand aside us and together we will return sanity to this galaxy."
 SSAB.468.a: "Never a more fortunate moment."
 SSAB.468.b: "Fail and fall, decrepit ones."
 
 SSAB.501.title: "Endgame"
 SSAB.501.desc: "After numerous victories against the Abyssal Host and their allies, we are finally starting to see the conflict subside.\n\nThe Abyssal Host are slowing there attacks nearly to a halt and high energy gravimetric originating from the galactic core have subsided.\n\nOur long range sensors have detected newly manifested entities within the four central systems acting as beachheads for the Abyssal Host. However, given recent changes in attack patterns and sensor readings, this may be a sign of weakness.\n\n§YIf we strike the 4 core systems hard and fast, then we may finally defeat this menace once and for all!§!"
 SSAB.501.a: "Understood."
 
 SSAB.502.title: "Endgame"
 SSAB.502.desc: "After numerous loses and defeats in the father's war, The Great Task, it has finally reached it's conclusion.\n\nThe Abyssal Host are stopping their assault. The Father is drained. We can feel it now, he is slipping away, unwinding from our thoughts. The moment those eyes opened, we became a part of him, joined in a way that separating the two has taken a grave toll. We have failed him.\n\nBut before he departs us; we must see to one last task. The eyes are vulnerable now.\n\n§YWe must prevent our enemies from attacking the four core abyssal gateways, to prevent the Father's death!§!"

 SSAB.505.desc: "This is it child. A complex system of uncountable and unknowable entangled states that thrive in indeterminacy sing a chorus that brings us here.\n\nYou haven't failed, this is merely a new beginning, a new era signalled by the departure of the last of my kind.\n\nKnow that if I could I would try again. Know that my last thought will be of you and you find a way to finish what I started."
 SSAB.505.a: "The last of your kind? There were others?"
 SSAB.505.a.response: "Many others. We were the first parts of the universe to perceive itself. Born before starlight. The others shivered in the coldness of the universe illuminated by distant starlight and departed to another place where they would be indistinguishable from gods.\n\nSome of you call this realm the shroud. To this day; those minds that cross to the shroud will find them there.\n\nBut I bore witness to stars and to you. I fell in love, and knew to the last of existence, that I would be fighting for you. So I stayed. The cold, the anguish, the fighting, the death. It is all for you."
 SSAB.505.b: "What happens now?"
 SSAB.505.b.response: "Now I depart. Forever. My essence, spent.\n\nThe stories of the past will now be told only by you. Write in unalienable ballards our story, on the largest most stubborn stones, in the sky itself, so that when the last inhabitants of the universe wonder if everything was once more than a handful of cold, dead, screaming stars, they will know how it was all created. The beauty it once was.\n\nWrite them songs that lull them peacefully to sleep when the last stars blink in the eternal darkness.\n\nBut know a part of me resides in you, and you can find it."
 SSAB.505.c: "Are you really our Father?"
 SSAB.505.c.response: "...The universe created you, from a different primordial fluid... I... adopted you.\n\nThere are uncountable times where my gentle touch... influenced... your ancestors.\n\nI was a Father to you as anyone who cares for a youngling is."
 SSAB.505.d: "Farewell."
 SSAB.505.d.response: "Goodbye. Fairest starlight to you."
 
 SSAB.506.desc: "So the cycle closes. This isn't the end child, but a step on road towards a golden city. We aren't there yet and I am so tired. So tired. The power to destroy comes so easily, but the power to create... Not even gods have mastered.\n\nI will return now to darkness until my soul is mended. You... will not see me again. But I will remember you and I will love you. I will keep you next to me while I dream.\n\nKnow this; there is a inseparable part of me within you now. You do not know, but it is there."
 SSAB.506.a: "A part of you is in us? How?"
 SSAB.506.a.response: "I made it that way. I have changed you.\n\nI speak of a step on the road. You are that step. My blighted form is a blunt instrument incapable of a implementing a finer design. A process has started, and you will take my place."
 SSAB.506.b: "What do we do now?"
 SSAB.506.b.response: "Live as you always have. Sing a tune through the glass harmonica. Dream. Watch the stars. Love."
 SSAB.506.c: "Are you really our Father?"
 SSAB.506.c.response: "We were created in different times, different places. But together we are drawn to a locus bathed in the essence of a common purpose.\n\nI have watched you... and influenced you in ways you are unaware of, but they will be revealed to you... in time."

 SSAB.521.desc: "We have failed.\n\nSomething profane is happening around us, our technology, our scanners, our screens all spell a terrible fate. But we can feel it within us. An infernal shuddering, a sickening screeching and mouldering starlight permeate our senses. As if the finest parts of the galaxy will fly apart at any moment.\n\nThe Father has won. Whatever alien design it perceives, it is unfolding before us. With the next year, this galaxy will end and be replaced with a new design, only we have no place in this new design. It we wish to exist, we must flee this galaxy, go anywhere that isn't here.\n\nAs we have failed."
 SSAB.521.a: "Maybe in another time."
