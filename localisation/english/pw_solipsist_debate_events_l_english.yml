    #Initial Choice:
    pw_solipsist_debate.1.name: "Alone in a Crossroad"
    pw_solipsist_debate.1.desc: "Many are the questions floating in Our mind all the time. Fortunately We can now canalize them to the Solipsist Debate Hall where designated drones shall ponder and discuss them. We need, however, to organize these thoughts and deliberate them in subjects and in parts.\nAlternatively, We can test our skills and distract Our Mind from these complicated topics by playing 5D Space Chess with the planetary supercomputer. All of Us against it, just to relax.\n\nAlready many thoughts fill the mind, with what shall We start?"
    pw_solipsist_debate.1.a: "Love."
    pw_solipsist_debate.1.a.tooltip: "All the individualists seem to talk about love in some way or another... perhaps this is something to consider?"

    pw_solipsist_debate.1.e: "We have no time for those futile debates."
    pw_solipsist_debate.1.e.tooltip: "We can decide latter to start a debate (with an edict)."

    #After first Choice:
    pw_solipsist_debate.2.name: "At The Crossroads Again"
    pw_solipsist_debate.2.desc: "There are still many thoughts to examine in the Debate Hall, and many unexplored options in previous topics.\n\nWhat shall We pursue next?"

    pw_solipsist_debate.2.c: "§LDeath.§!"

    #Love
    #Love Initial
    pw_solipsist_debate.10.name: "Symposium"
    pw_solipsist_debate.10.desc: "Love?\nWhat a waste of time.\n\nWell, there is a word for the concept in almost every other language in the galaxy, and the individualists are always referring to it in some form or another. Their loved ones, their love for their emperor, their love for their people, their love for their country, their love for adventure, and so on. Perhaps there is something to it after all...\n\nBut where should We start?\nAre all those loves the same love?\nCan love change over time?\nCan one have multiple loves?\nCan We love? Should We Love?\n\nToo complicated! Let us start from the primitive conceptions; they must be simpler. As our analysis suggests, Love is related to mating."
    pw_solipsist_debate.10.a: "Indeed, Love must mean reproduction."

    #Love Decision:
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.name: "Lovers Choice"
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.desc: "As it turns out, simply with reproduction We end up with more of Us, and no more satisfied. Shouldn't love be satisfaction? Maybe not. This cannot be all there is. That does not match any obtained description of Love.\n\nThere were option of Love which could not reproduce, some more abstract ones, at that. At least in this time We could develop some notions of what love could be...\nWe should commit to one and see what comes of that."
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.a: "To Love is to Care."
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.b: "To Love is to Contemplate."
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.c: "Love is nothing more than desire with an excuse."
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.d: "There is only love for the Self, the rest is projection."
    pw_solipsist_debate.11.e: "There is only Consumption, nothing more."

    #Love Final 1
    pw_solipsist_debate.12.name: "Love Is Care"
    pw_solipsist_debate.12.desc: "With this time of reflection We have determined somethings about love.\n\nLove is about the small things. Love is everyday acts. Love is the care one has for others and for oneself.\nIn this period We have enjoyed reduced levels of deviancy from drones making maintenance in each other, the best way We could emulate love. It was fine, but lacked the passion of previous attempts. It is more clear to Us why other empires have it in so high regard. it was in some ways healthy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.12.a: "Love makes more sense now, but We don't have the full picture."

    #Love Final 2
    pw_solipsist_debate.13.name: "Love Is Contemplation"
    pw_solipsist_debate.13.desc: "With this time of reflection We have determined somethings about love.\n\nLove is for the great things of the universe. Love is passion. Love is in some ways something We can't obtain.\nIn this period We have looked at the universe with other eyes - lustful eyes - for its mysteries. It has, undoubtedly improved our research, but done noting to provide satisfaction, each new discovery only led to more questions. The desire to explore, to see, to experience only brought more desire. We can see why adventures cast themselves in impossible quests, but there is still something else to it."
    pw_solipsist_debate.13.a: "Love makes more sense now, but We don't have the full picture."

    #Love Final 3
    pw_solipsist_debate.14.name: "Love Is Desire"
    pw_solipsist_debate.14.desc: "With this time of reflection We have determined somethings about love.\n\nLove can't exist in all the ways it is talked about. Love is simply chemicals in action. Love can very well be a malformed excuse.\nIn this period We have concentrated efforts to expand and take the territories We liked with this flimsy pretext called love. It does not need to be said that nothing about love was learned and the justification was unsustained. However We have reached interesting conclusions: it is best to simply surrender to the electrical impulses than it is to fight your nature with delusional excuses."
    pw_solipsist_debate.14.a: "Wait that was not about love! There must be more to it."

    #Love Final 4
    pw_solipsist_debate.15.name: "Love Is Only For The Self"
    pw_solipsist_debate.15.desc: "With this time of reflection We have determined somethings about love.\n\nLove is indeed to care. Love is indeed to contemplate. Love is indeed desire. To care for, to contemplate and to desire ourselves.\nIn truth, We have can only be absolutely sure of one thing: We exist. Nothing else in the galaxy has that guaranteed. Therefore, love must be solipsist, there is no other way. To love something else is to waste time, We did good to turn to our own affairs with more vigor in this time."
    pw_solipsist_debate.15.a: "Unless... We are wrong, and there is more to existence than Us."

    #Love Final 5
    pw_solipsist_debate.16.name: "There Is No Love"
    pw_solipsist_debate.16.desc: "With this time of reflection We have mostly ignored discussions of love for they are absurd. There is no love. The others are completely wrong.\n\nThere is only one thing to the universe in all its extension: survival.\nWe can only agree with those that call love for what it is: weakness.\nSurvival demands consumption and consumption rejects love."
    pw_solipsist_debate.16.a: "That justifies our existence, but does it have merit beyond coldness?"


    #Freedom
    #Freedom Determinism?
    pw_solipsist_debate.20.name: "Freedom From Or Freedom To?"
    pw_solipsist_debate.20.desc: "Before determining what freedom is and if We are truly free in whatever definition, from the multitude encountered in the galaxy, We must first determine if the universe would allow us to be free.\n\nFrom what We could gather there could only be two options for how causality operates in reality.\n\nEither every action performed in a certain state of the universe causes a specific - predictable - change in such state. Therefore the universe is deterministic and everything that will happen is already determined. The future is already laid out because it depends exclusively on the past and there is nothing We can do to change it.\n\nOr the universe is not deterministic and there is some, so called, free will that can be used to change the state of the world in unpredictable events. Or that there is some higher form - or simply chance, really - that forbids chosen outcomes independent of actions taken. Both of those options would mean there are things in the universe We cannot possibly know, provenly so."
    pw_solipsist_debate.20.a: "The universe must be deterministic."
    pw_solipsist_debate.20.b: "The universe must not be deterministic."
    pw_solipsist_debate.20.c: "It doesn't matter, but We can only discuss this if it is not deterministic."

    #Freedom Determinism Yes
    pw_solipsist_debate.21.name: "Having no Choice Makes us Free From Choices"
    pw_solipsist_debate.21.desc: "With this time to reflect We have come to the conclusion that the universe must be deterministic. As it is at the core of our research methods, in the conception that repetition of experiments must yield the same results for the same conditions, changing this paradigm now would be too damaging to our stellar progress.\nThis assertion carries some implications to Our place in the universe. Everything that will happen in absolutely predictable and dreadfully unavoidable. We can only do what We were meant to do and nothing else. Even the acknowledgement of this fact could be predicted before, if We had all the data.\n\nOther empires would certainty find this conclusion despairing, but not We. We know that the universe cares not about what one thinks of it and will continue exactly as it is meant to. And so should We."
    pw_solipsist_debate.21.a: "We can still debate explanations, should the universe were not determinist."
    pw_solipsist_debate.21.b: "Freedom lost its meaning for us, but the others might think of it as something else."
    pw_solipsist_debate.21.c: "Well, this is pointless. Better end this discussion now!"

    #Freedom Determinism No
    pw_solipsist_debate.22.name: "Is it Our Will to Think of Free Will?"
    pw_solipsist_debate.22.desc: "With this time to reflect We have come to the conclusion that for the universe to be deterministic is preposterous. Not only it would render any efforts of the Gestalt to achieve anything completely worthless, but it would make the entirety of existence an exercise in pointlessness. We cannot accept that.\nFrom this assertion, there are two paths to take from here: We can explore the ways in which the Universe is nondeterministic, and take a closer look to chains of causality and how they wer to operate; or We can assume that nondeterminism and finally come around to the discussion on freedom We have proposed, and analyse in which ways We could be free."
    pw_solipsist_debate.22.a: "We should investigate the machinations of the universe."
    pw_solipsist_debate.22.b: "We should keep on track and discuss freedom already."
    pw_solipsist_debate.22.c: "No, there can only be pointlessness in the world. This debate ends now!"

    #Freedom Determinism Explained
    pw_solipsist_debate.23.name: "There is More Between Heaven and Earth"
    pw_solipsist_debate.23.desc: "Under the hypothesis that the universe is not deterministic, it must mean that something interferes with logical causality chains, that is to say, the same action performed in the same state of the universe, must be able to have different outcomes. If the outcomes ought to be the same, not only that would mean that everything until the end of the universe could be predicted, but also it could not be any different from the current course. To be honest, logic itself is a [ROOT.GetAdjective] invention and nothing guarantees that the universe follow those simple directives, but that is an argument for another time.\nLooking at how other empires - naively, should We add - tackle this issues, given most follow a similar cause-effect model of the universe, We can see two opposite theories surface:\n    A. There is some higher form of being that dictates the rules of the universe, like an operator of a system, that is not subject to the rules they themselves propose.\n    B. There are undeterminable factors baked in the rules of the universe that prevents us from mapping every possible outcome. Not only lack of information, but the lack of possibility of obtaining the needed information.\nAlso, there are those who combine these two theories in a syncretic mess. It is best not to take of this line of thought, as it gives many drones headaches."
    pw_solipsist_debate.23.a: "There is something in the machine."
    pw_solipsist_debate.23.b: "There are uncertainties in play."

    #Freedom Determinism Doesn't Matter
    pw_solipsist_debate.24.name: "Our Hands Are No Longer Tied"
    pw_solipsist_debate.24.desc: "To examine these abstract ideas of determinism is all well and good, but We should focus on the material reality of our existence: what is freedom? Can We be free? Does it make a difference?\n\nOther empires have different solutions to these issues.\nIf one asks the slaver empires, they will affirm their slaves are happy, and to serve is what they want, to which the slaves themselves confirm, specially after being nerve stapled. We need to separate here happiness and freedom, there is no difference between happiness and the illusion of happiness, after all. But if one were to argue that the slaves are doing what they want, We could only reply that they had no choice in the first place. Maybe the lack of choice is what makes us free?\nOn the other hand egalitarian empires vehemently reject that idea and argue for the more sophisticated point: that to call for freedom matters very little when the alternative is death. To choose between yor own life and death is no choice at all. And decisions made at gunpoint are really made by those holding the gun.\n\nWe must decide which of these ideals to pursue, and We are left with the final thought that to abstain from choice is still choosing."
    pw_solipsist_debate.24.a: "To be free is to do what We want. There is no question of that."
    pw_solipsist_debate.24.b: "There can only be freedom when We are free to not starve."

    #Freedom God
    pw_solipsist_debate.25.name: "Something in the Machine"
    pw_solipsist_debate.25.desc: "After many years of contemplation, We concluded that there is much value in the teachings of spiritualists throughout the galaxy. Most try to understand what we now think is some form of divine power, that orders the galaxy. We propose that the divergency on their beliefs comes from trying to understand parts of a whole without seeing the complete picture.\nThis divine force - the nature of which We don't fully understand - must be what prevents determinism and the work of the inexorable fate. That force is the only thing that can guarantee our free will. Or take it from Us.\n\nSomething left to wonder is wht it would take to become or to project such a force in the universe..."
    pw_solipsist_debate.25.a: "Praise be this divine force... for now."
    pw_solipsist_debate.25.b: "There is still the issue of freedom to discuss."

    #Freedom Chance
    pw_solipsist_debate.26.name: "Uncertainties in Principle"
    pw_solipsist_debate.26.desc: "After uncountable debates, We must consider the correct the materialist position about the operations universe. There is no superstition. There is no luck. There is nothing that can can't be explained. But there are things that cannot be known.\nFollowing principles of wave theory, coined such a long time ago, we can affirm that there are pair of information which we cannot know at the same time. Therefore, We cannot make a complete map of the universe which renders it fundamentally unpredictable.Although We can make very good guesses."
    pw_solipsist_debate.26.a: "We must continue, even if uncertainty is unavoidable."
    pw_solipsist_debate.26.b: "There is still the issue of freedom to discuss."

    #Freedom Auth
    pw_solipsist_debate.27.name: "We Are What We Make Ourselves"
    pw_solipsist_debate.27.desc: "Given such a conundrum the simple answer must be the correct one: We are free if We do what We want. Nothing else matters in this conception.\nLogically it follows that We, the Gestalt, must be the most free being in the galaxy; all the time the drones are doing exactly what they want to be doing, for it is our will, the common will. Which is very different from slaves. However We could argue that slaves who want to be slaves are equally as free. This makes sense, indeed.\n\nTherefore, the only things that stand in our way to absolute freedom are the laws of nature, and as such, they must be subverted at all times; at all costs."
    pw_solipsist_debate.27.a: "Let Us work towards that future, everything is permitted!"

    #Freedom Eq
    pw_solipsist_debate.28.name: "Nothing to Lose But Chains"
    pw_solipsist_debate.28.desc: "After much reflection on the state of the universe, there is only one possible conclusion: There can only be freedom, in every conceivable definition, where there is no need. If there is scarcity of essentials, like food, any choice made must be coerced by that scarcity. Any coerced choice, in any degree, is not a free choice.\nLogically it follows that We, as a Gestalt, are very free to choose in times of abundance, for all is available to all. But the same can not be said of many empires in this galaxy. Anywhere that dos not provide to its inhabitants when it is able, may never claim that they are truly free. Any empire that takes coerced actions because of another empire's influence is, equally, not free.\n\nWhat is reveled is this ruminations is the amount of empires that call themselves free, but are much too far from it."
    pw_solipsist_debate.28.a: "Should We strive for a free galaxy? Is that even possible?"

    #Chess
    #Chess Initial
    pw_solipsist_debate.40.name: "Hive's Gambit"
    pw_solipsist_debate.40.desc: "We should take a break from all of this debating and projecting abstract scenarios, to relax and play a comfortable game of 5D-Chess with the supercomputer terminal installed in the Debate Hall.\n5D-Chess is a simple game for Us, We have remarkable spatial perception with so many eyes producing images at the same time, the only difficulty comes from managing time and different timelines but experience shall sharpen Our skills.\nThe game uses a variation of 3D Chess in which peaces can be moved in or into the past, creating different timelines; peaces can also move between timelines. The game is over when a check-mate is performed in any current timeline, at any time. 5D-Chess is really just warmup for the real game: 6D-Chess, which uses a variation of 4D space, but We have to start somewhere.\n\nSuch a sophisticated game against such a skilled opponent can last decades, but for now the supercomputer interface cordially offers Us the first move. We need to determine Our starting strategy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.40.a: "Go for an Aggressive strategy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.40.b: "Better be safe with a Defensive strategy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.40.c: "Try Esoteric moves, let Us be unpredictable."

    pw_solipsist_debate.41.desc: "That strategy paid out!\nWith the correct feints and strategic sacrifices, in the correct places at the correct times, We managed to get ahead with more peaces in most timelines.\nThe battle is no over, however, and We must decide whether to continue with Our strategy, if We are confident in Our luck so far, or to change and surprise Our opponent. We can always appeal to bolder, esoteric, moves and hope to confuse Our opponent until We can claim victory."
    pw_solipsist_debate.41.a: "Why change what is working? Continue the strategy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.41.b: "Never let your opponent be comfortable. Change the strategy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.41.c: "They will never see this coming, try esoteric moves."

    #Chess Losing
    pw_solipsist_debate.42.name: "Castling"
    pw_solipsist_debate.42.desc: "Our strategy wasn't the best.\nAll of Our bluffs were called and We had to trade more away than We could get back. All in all, We have amassed more losses than Our opponent, which puts Us in a complicated spot. We must choose the following steps with care.\nShould We insist in the previous strategy, and hope that it pays out now? Or should we change and try to win by cutting Our losses? We can also try something different, very different and unpredictable, and try to confuse Our opponent to victory."
    pw_solipsist_debate.42.a: "We were almost dominating that timeline! We should keep going."
    pw_solipsist_debate.42.b: "It is wise to know when to retreat tactically. Change the strategy!"
    pw_solipsist_debate.42.c: "We have nothing to lose now, let Us try everything, be unpredictable."

    pw_solipsist_debate.43.name: "The Grand Game"
    pw_solipsist_debate.43.desc: "Our last move in the long game of 5D-Chess reveled something We were not expecting, the thought pattern behind the board state and the evaluation of the best outcome can be elegantly mapped to the understating of technology being researched.\n\nWe have made a great breakthrough in the grand game of the galaxy."
    pw_solipsist_debate.43.a: "But what about the game?"

    #Chess Esoteric Win
    pw_solipsist_debate.44.name: "Scholar's Mate"
    pw_solipsist_debate.44.desc: "After a series of seemingly unconnected plays in the 5d-Chess game, that conceded a lot of ground to our opponent, surprisingly, We notice that victory can be achieved with a single extra move, and there is nothing the computer can do to to prevent it. Our simulations didn't saw this coming, and We concluded theirs failed to see it too. After taking a year to consider every possible outcome, We commit to the next play and, in a masterfully executed game, claim victory!"
    pw_solipsist_debate.44.a: "That was easy. Rematch?"

    #Chess Esoteric Loss
    pw_solipsist_debate.45.name: "Fool's Mate"
    pw_solipsist_debate.45.desc: "After exactly three moves after adopting this esoteric strategy in the 5D-Chess game, which took half a decade to assert, the computer surprised Us with a simple pawn placed at the right place at the right time that gave them the win.\n\nSometimes, weird strategies are just that: weird, and not actually useful."

    pw_solipsist_debate.46.desc: "After an intense game of 5D-Chess, filled with back and forth (literally in space and time), called bluffs and good trades, We have emerged victorious!\nThe game was difficult, and our strategy solid, but the last few years of the game was just considering the alternatives Our opponent had to not lose, We had already won.\nThis was a great exercise and a rewarding game."

    pw_solipsist_debate.48.desc: "After an intense game of 5D-Chess, filled with back and forth (literally in space and time), incredible turns and a great deal os resilience from both players, the supercomputer offers a Draw. Indeed, none of Our analyses show any sing of victory or defeat of any of the parts, the last 136 moves have been repeated several times and led back to the same spot in the game. We find the only way of ending the game is agreeing with the draw, no player could overcome the other and We may have found a worthy opponent."
