Due to this, the structures are visible even from orbit.\n\nOur scientists are unable to determine what materials comprise these grids, despite thorough investigation. It seems to be a combination of a translucent material core surrounded by a liquid layer of crystals with some form of super-resistant outer layer made from unknown components.\n\nInitial studies lead us to believe that these vast networks are powered by giant thermal plants deep within the planet's crust. Unfortunately, the vast thermal vents these networks eventually lead to are too deep and too hot to currently explore. Our scientists are certain that these networks should be compatible with our own energy systems with some minor modifications. "
