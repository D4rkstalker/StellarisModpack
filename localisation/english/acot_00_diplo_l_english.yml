acot_diplo.3.d: "How about no."
acot_diplo.3.d.response: "I see...so you have shown your true colors at last. You see us not as friends or allies, just deterrances? or perhaps even worse. We will not forget this, nor any of your friends. Let the galaxy know of [root.GetName]'s true nature."

acot_diplo.5.desc: "One of our science ship has been ambushed by an unknown group of pirates! Reports indicated that these pirates have been hired by another empire.

acot_diplo.10.desc.spiritualist: "Heretics! You dare defile the sacred dark matter arts with your profane and corrupted alterations!? This atrocity cannot be overlooked!\n\nAs the holy guardians of the one true faith, we demand you surrender your corrupted technologies at once, or we will bring divine punishment upon your misbegotten kind!."
acot_diplo.10.desc.materialist: "What is the meaning of this? [FallenEmpireTaskTarget.GetName], you have violated the established regulations regarding the use of dangerous technologies as per Codex GTX-3198 Page 133337-163641. §R"Under no circumstances are the class-5 technology empires be permitted to make alterations to the Dark Matter-based technologies without our supervisions."§!.\n\nWe must now enforce the law and confiscate all of your technologies. Once we can verify the potentials and dangers, you will be permitted to retain any technologies we deemed appopriate. Resist and we will use lethal forces, the technological supremacy of [from.GetName] must  prevail."
acot_diplo.10.desc.xenophile: "[FallenEmpireTaskTarget.GetName], you are attempting to use technologies that goes beyond our safety regluations. We can see that you are going to use it for malicious ends. This we cannot allow. We [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] are the guardians of this galaxy, and thus it falls to our duty to ensure that your wrongdoings cannot go unpunished.\n\nReturn those technologies to us, and we will not write you as a criminal harboring dangerous powers."
acot_diplo.10.desc.xenophobe: "Fools, you think your foolish attempts to surpass us has not gone unnoticed!? We command and conquer you to hand us the techs that you recently acquired, and we will kill you. Refuse, and we will kill you. The choice is clear. You have no say in this matter."

acot_diplo.10.b: "Meh, take it. It won't save you from our awesome wrath."
acot_diplo.10.b.tooltip: "The Fallen Empire will awake and acquire all advanced technologies that they have somehow never managed to learn for over million of years while we could do so in a span of couple years. But at least they won't declare war on us right away."
acot_diplo.10.b.response: "We shall see. Executor, prepare to confiscate all technologies and bring the technology cache aboard our homeworld for study."

acot_diplo.10.c: "§Y(Speech 100)§! Our goal is to develop this new power for your use, great one."
acot_diplo.10.c.tooltip: "We will pretend to give them the technologies, but little will they know that the cache inside is filled with class-14 Singularity Bombs that will cause massive explosions.\n\nObviously this will anger them a lot but who cares~."
acot_diplo.10.c.response: "Ah, so that's why you were so eager to develop it. But next time, notify us before hand for your own good.\n\nExecutor, prepare to confiscate all technologies and bring the technology cache aboard our homeworld for study. We begin preparations at once!"

acot_diplo.13.name: "The Old One Awakes"
acot_diplo.13.desc: "An interesting development within the galactic climate has occurred. Apparently, someone must have made the [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] very very angry, as they have decided to stop being dormant and have once again awakened to reclaim their lost glory."
acot_diplo.13.a: "Yeah, yeah. Big deal."
acot_diplo.13.b: "Well, its bound to happen eventually."

acot_diplo.16.desc.phobe: "Impossible! How can this be!?\n\nOur empires have existed since the beginning of times! How dare such insignificant pile of rubbish like you prevail over us? What kind of foul schemes did you use? This cannot stand!"
acot_diplo.16.desc.phile: "You have won this war, but that is solely because the council has pressed our hands. We did not wish to utilize the full powers of our arsenals, otherwise this would be different!\n\nBut a loss is a loss. Hopefully we will not have to speak again."
acot_diplo.16.desc.spirit: "Unthinkable! We have lost!?\n\nPerhaps our devotion to the gods were not strong enough. This must have been their punishments. O Great Shroud, we understand it clearly now.\n\n[Root.GetName], you have our thanks, we will strengthen our resolves and return again to war. For now, your existences will be spared. Now begone."
acot_diplo.16.desc.mat: "We lost...WE LOST??? DID WE JUST LOSE TO YOU? The probability of our defeat was less than 13.337%, clearly there must be a bug in our logic calculators. Perhaps we used the wrong machines. This is not over, we will return to claim what is ours! Now, begone!"
acot_diplo.16.a: "You lost to us. Now honor the claims, give us your techs."
acot_diplo.16.a.response: "WHAT!?...you little sc..gah!\n\nAre you trying to test us? Do you think we are not afraid to own up to our mistakes? You think us as cowards and fools?! Think again!\n\nFine, you can have one of our secrets, not like your inferior intellects can make any use of it anyway. You will never defeat us if we ever went 100% serious! This was not even our final form."
acot_diplo.16.b: "Not so fast, compensations must be made for this war."
acot_diplo.16.b.response: "Ugh, fine. Here's your resources. Children these days, all they want is money."
acot_diplo.16.c: "Uh ah. No no no, first you must be humilated. Apologize to the galaxy."

acot_diplo.17.desc: "See, you plebians know nothing of warfare. The fact that you still managed to lose despite having conceived such an advanced technology is a testament to how pathetic you are. Such powers are not meant to be used by weaklings.\n\nTo ensure there will be no further mistakes, all of your leaders will be executed., and all of your technologies will now be ours to command and conquer. Your resources will be drained. Your fleets will be destroyed.\n\nConsider  yourselves lucky, our ancestors would have done much worse."
acot_diplo.17.a: "Woops."

acot_diplo.18.name: "Epic Fail"
acot_diplo.18.desc.others: "Woah! Something shocking happened. Apparently something terribly wrong has occured on the capital system of the [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName]! The capital planet just blew up, and all fleets orbiting the system have been turned into smoking craters.\n\nSomething must have gone horribly wrong for them."
acot_diplo.18.desc: "It worked! It actually worked! The foolish fallen empire transported our rigged cache of technologies on board their capital and it exploded! KA-BOOM!\n\nReports indicate the entire navy stationed aboard their homeworld has been evaporated and their decripit homeworld is now thing but a charred and burnt crisp."
acot_diplo.18.a: "This outcome is inevitable, given their lack of common senses."
acot_diplo.18.b: "They are called fallen empires for a reason."

acot_diplo.19.name: "The Final Voyage"
acot_diplo.19.desc.others: "Woah! Something shocking just happened. Apparently something terribly wrong has occured on the capital system of the [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName]! The capital planet just blew up and caused a massive chain-reaction that somehow caused the entire empire's infrastructure to combust into a massive Dark Matter explosion. The Fallen Empire is no more."
acot_diplo.19.desc: "It worked! It actually worked! In fact...it may have worked way too well...\n\nThe idiotic grandpas transported our rigged cache of technologies on board their capital and it exploded and caused a massive chain-reaction that somehow blew up their entire empire. Their decrepit and volatile Dark Matter Reactors must have been too outdated and too old to contain."
acot_diplo.19.a: "What a waste of space. Good riddance."
acot_diplo.19.b: "Will anyone even mourn them? They were quite annoying."


acot_diplo.20.desc: "Denizens of the Galaxy, we are the [FROM.GetName] and we are here to broadcast a very important message...\n\nIn our arrogance, we have declared war upon the Galaxy's greatest champions and were pounded into submission as a result of our critical lack of skills.\n\nWe are terribly sorry to everyone for being such...such naughty old-timers. Please don't eat us...\n\nWe...we...ENOUGH OF THIS!!\n\n§Y<Sounds of breaking glasses and angry stomping>§!"
