One day the machines simply stopped working, forcing us to fend for ourselves for the first time in generations. Many perished in the aftermath, unable to survive this new, unforgiving world. In time we learned to mastered our caretakers' old infrastructure, creating a new civilization from the ashes.\n\nIt was among the ruins that we found our caretakers' final gift: the incomplete designs for a hyper drive engine.
