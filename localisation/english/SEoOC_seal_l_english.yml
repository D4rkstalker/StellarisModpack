 nep_seal.2.name:0 "Dangerous Roadblock"
 nep_seal.2.desc:0 "In [From.GetName] our ship almost hit a pile of wrecks that don't know where to come. After the analysis of the age, this is the wreckage left by ancient times. Maybe we should analyze whether there is something valuable inside? At least, we have to do the cleanup - the end of the roadblock itself reveals that this pile of things must be cleared."

 nep_seal.2.b:0 "Let the cleanup team set off, although it will cost a few energy credit..." 
 
 nep_seal.3.name:0 ""Cleanup" Complete"
 nep_seal.3.desc:0 "The scientists' "cleaning up" work at [From.GetName] is complete. We found the black box inside, and after analysis, it uncovered the secret of why this stuff would become a pile of cosmic garbage. It seems that the ship was attacked here -- not knowing who the attacker is -- and then failed to make an emergency FTL. After analyzing the reasons for the FTL failure, our scientists learned that the entire highway was easy to fail because of unclear reasons. (We shouldn't choose to be a battlefield here at any time.) And next,we found a white, unidentified orb in the wreckage. Our instruments felt a strange, directed energy response in this orb. We can't do a destructive analysis -- there is no tool can cut off this orb. "

 nep_seal.5.name:0 "End of battle"
 nep_seal.5.desc:0 "The war on the growth of unidentified forces is over.After analyzing a large number of samples, the scientists have figured out a lot of things:first of all, these forces seem to be the ancient guardian of the highway. Second, the other role of these highways is to seal something. These fleets are designed to protect the seal from damage. Then it may be because the maintenance fee is insufficient, and it is used as a highway to earn maintenance fees. This is also why this highway is so... round. Now we don't know where the seal is, but scientists think this seal is related to the orb we got before. In addition, when we completely eliminated the unidentified forces, orb has some reaction. We can try to activate it."
 nep_seal.5.a:0 "Very funny. Let's try. " 
 nep_seal.5.a.tooltip:0 "Now ancient orb can be active as a relic.Will continue scenario after active."

 nep_seal.6.desc:0 "After the activation of orb, its energy points to many points: including the center of the universe--the scientists thought that this was the location of the seal mentioned earlier, and some special areas that could be used as the foothold of jump drive: these special space were called §YStep to the Void §!by ancient people. There is nothing inside, but nobody knows why it can be used as a transit point for jump drives, and can reach the center of the seal system through several jumps. However, the information left in all guardians is emphasized - §R The seal is very dangerous, never open! §!"
 nep_seal.6.a:0 "The science team will go immediately! " 
 nep_seal.6.b:0 "It sounds really dangerous. Forget it, the life of the people is more important. " 
 
 nep_seal.7.name:0 "The Seal"
 nep_seal.7.desc:0 "As scientists have inferred over the years, the galaxy center is really a large black hole -- bigger than any known. In addition, there are three "small" black holes around it -- although it is actually very large -- to maintain balance in an unidentified way. The place where the orb's energy point to is a position next to the big black hole--let the scientists go and see? "
 nep_seal.7.a:0 "Go ahead." 
 nep_seal.7.b:0 "It's a wonder of the universe. But I don't want to continue anymore. "

Inside is the seal are §Y finalweapons §!, but once it is out of control, the entire Galaxy is finished. They regrets the invention of this finalweapon, but once the Galaxy has a crisis, this ultimate weapon may still be useful, so seal it in the big seal. --- But we did not find the relevant information of the Galaxy Highway. Maybe it is not the ancient people of the same era who made this seal and made the highway?"
