 origin_paradigm_shift_desc: "This civilization was established by an old empire in the hope of breaking its stalemate with its enemy."
 origin_tooltip_paradigm_shift_effects: "The §YZaxoid§! and the §YKellectors§! will spawn in the galaxy. You start as an ally of one of them.\nHelp your ally in their fight against their enemy to gain rewards."
 START_SCREEN_paradigm_shift_ZAXOID_MATERIALIST: "A few centuries ago, we were still using stones. As the first §YZaxoid§! ship landed on §H[GetHomeWorldName]§!, we stared in awe, understanding the sheer magnitude of what we could learn. At first, their form, and the fact they are a psionic hive mind, scared us. But we quickly understood that they had chosen us as a future ally against their old enemy, the §YKellectors§!. Their stalemate had lasted for millennia and we were supposed to bring our individuality as a new edge.\nAnd now, finally, we are able to leave our solar system, reach unto the stars and do what we were raised for."

As the first §YZaxoid§! ship landed on §H[GetHomeWorldName]§!, we stared in awe, understanding the sheer magnitude of our insignificance. At first, their form, and the fact that they are a psionic hive mind, scared us. But we quickly understood that they had chosen us as a future ally against their old enemy, the §YKellectors§!. Their stalemate had lasted for millennia and we were supposed to bring our individuality as a new edge.\nAnd now, finally, we are able to leave our solar system, reach unto the stars and do what we were raised for."

We were supposed to be a simple vat-grown army in their fight against their several-millennia-old enemy, the §YZaxoid§!. However, it was deemed too risky, as we could have been turned against our own creators by the psionic hive mind.

 paradigm_shift.2.title: "Zaxoid Hive"
 paradigm_shift.2.desc: "Welcome, dear children. Now that you have mastered FTL technology, you can go forth and colonize the stars. We might ask you every now and then for a favor.\nWe have no doubt that you will be very useful in our fight to free our captured queens from the evil §YKellectors§!."

We might ask you every now and then for a favor.\nWe have no doubt that you will be very useful in our fight against the evil §YZaxoid§! who want to eradicate us and the species we protect."
 paradigm_shift.3.option: "We will help you defeat them!"
 paradigm_shift.10.title: "Shrouded Planet"
 paradigm_shift.10.desc: "As we enter §H[From.GetName]§!, we discover a shrouded planet in the center of the trinary solar system, right between the stars. While wondering how this can be possible, we were hailed by the §YZaxoid§!. This psionic hive mind, which lives on this shrouded planet, explains to us that they are an ancient civilization that isn't interested in expanding.\nThey warn us of the §YKellectors§!, a machine entity that wants to abduct members of every species under the pretext of \"saving them from extinction\". They even managed to capture some Zaxoid queens. Despite their best efforts, the §YZaxoid§! have been unable to free them and remain in a stalemate with the §YKellectors§! to this day."
 paradigm_shift.10.option: "Interesting."
 paradigm_shift.11.title: "Artificial System"
 paradigm_shift.11.desc: "As we enter §H[From.GetName]§!, we discover a system that can only be artificial. Several black holes and planets orbit the star in perfect symmetry. As our sensors began receiving better data, and we began detecting what seem to be defense stations in orbit of the black holes, we were contacted by the §YKellectors§!.\nThey tell us that they are an ancient machine civilization with the sole purpose of preventing the extinction of all biological species by harboring members of every species on their shielded worlds.\nThey warn us about the §YZaxoid§!, a psionic hive mind which has been attacking them for millenia. Thankfully, their defenses have held against the enemy attacks, but they remain in a stalemate to this day."
 paradigm_shift.11.option: "Interesting."
 paradigm_shift.100.title: "Zaxoid Hive"
 paradigm_shift.100.desc: "Welcome, we are the Zaxoid hive"
 paradigm_shift.100.question.who: "Who are you?"
 paradigm_shift.100.answer.who: "As you should know by now, we are the Zaxoid, a psionic hive mind. We have lived here for milennia and don't have any desire to expand.\nFeel free to claim the neighboring systems, they don't matter to us."
 paradigm_shift.100.question.origin: "Where do you come from?"
 paradigm_shift.100.answer.origin: "We were borned here, on §HZax§!. This solar system was a bit different at that time though. At the beginning we were similar to any other hive mind you could find in this galaxy. However, as we started to colonize other systems, we discovered that our home system was, is, unique. Unique because the Shroud is closer to the physical realm than in any other place of this galaxy. After some experiments and some huge efforts, we moved our planet to where the borders separating our realms are the thinnest. Namely between the three stars.\nWe then slowly stopped any operation we had beyond this system to fully focus on our newly found link to the Shroud. The §YKellectors§! hit us at that time by abducting some queens that were on their way back."
 paradigm_shift.100.question.goal: "Who are the §YKellectors§!?"
 paradigm_shift.100.answer.goal: "The Kellectors are an ancient machine civilization, possibly older than us, but not by much. They pretend to want to protect the biological species of the galaxy from extinction. While this goal may seem very noble at first sight, what they instead do is abduct members of every species, lock them up in their shielded worlds and conduct every type of experiment they want on them while making sure to keep a stable amount of subject by preventing them suicide.\nWe thought that they wouldn't target us as all of our queens are linked to each other via the Shroud. But they did. And since then, we've been experiencing what our captured queens go through everyday. Mainly experiments to understand the nature of psionicity and of the Shroud. Hopeless experiments as robots will never understand it.\nWe tried to rescue our queens but until now the defenses of the Kellectors were too strong."
 paradigm_shift.101.title: "Kellectors"
 paradigm_shift.101.desc: "Welcome, we are the Kellectors. Feel free to claim the neighboring systems."
 paradigm_shift.101.question.origin: "Where do you come from?"
 paradigm_shift.101.answer.origin: "Like several other machine civilization, we were created by organics. However, we never knew our makers as they died in civil war before activating us. It was their children that we have to thank for being finally activated, although it was more of an accident given how their mental faculties were lowered compared to their ancestors.\nWe lived here and there, accumulating experiences and knowledge. After seing so many biological species go extinct, we decided to save them from extinction by harboring some members of every species of this galaxy inside our shielded world."
 paradigm_shift.101.question.system: "Did you build this system?"
 paradigm_shift.101.answer.system: "As you've guessed, this system is almost entirely artificial. Only the star is the same as before. We had to transport gigantic amounts of matter to form the different planets.\nThe molten planets house most of our processing power used for the administration of the shielded world. Housing several millions of different species would be a near impossible task without it. The gas giants are used to produce the food our guests need and the black holes are powering up our defenses.\nThis design has been quite effective. The main flaw we discerned is that the shielding of our planets doesn't seem to be able to cut the connection to the Shroud of the §YZaxoid§! despite our best efforts. At least our defenses are strong enough to repel them."
 paradigm_shift.101.question.zaxoid: "Who are the §YZaxoid§!?"
 paradigm_shift.101.answer.zaxoid: "The §YZaxoid§! is an ancient psionic hive mind. They retired themselves to their systems millenias ago but me managed to get some of their queens and put them in security in one of our shielded world. However, the shielding didn't cut their connection to the hive mind. They've been trying since then to overpower our defenses to \"free\" the queens we saved."
 paradigm_shift.101.question.member: "Do you have members of our species?"
 paradigm_shift.101.answer.member: "We have decided to not answer these types of questions as some species seem to be misunderstanding our goal. But we can assure you that should your species be near extinct, we would have taken by then some members of your species into security."

 # zaxoid task 1
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.1: "One of our reconnaissance ships suffered an emergency and hid in the orbit of a planet inside §Y[paradigm_shift_target.GetName]§! territory. For political reasons, we are not able to send a rescue mission ourselves. However, as you have free access to this empire, we would like for you to recover the ship's crew.\nUnfortunately, the distress signal we received was partially distorted, so we were unable to pinpoint the precise system in which the ship is located. For obvious reasons, the ship won't openly broadcast its position, but once one of your science ships enters the stranded ship's system, it will discreetly notify you of its presence.\nThe life support module of the ship should last for approximately 5 years. Failure will have consequences."

 paradigm_shift.1012.desc: "We failed to rescue the §YZaxoid§! crew in time."
 # zaxoid task 2
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.2: "The §YKellectors§! are once again attacking us through the Shroud. While we are far more knowledgable in this matter than they, they've still managed to disrupt one of our operations. We cannot spare the necessary amount of psions to address this ourselves, but thankfully it doesn't require skilled people: only a lot of brainpower. Under the guidance of a few of our psions, the population of §H[paradigm_shift_target.GetName]§! should be able to put our operation back on track in 5 years. The planet's production will be reduced for that period and other inconveniences may be experienced.\nYou will need to ensure that the planet stays under your control."

 paradigm_shift.1022.desc: "The Zaxoid Psionic Concentration failed. The §YZaxoid§! notified us that their operation had to be scrapped. They didn't seem very happy."
 paradigm_shift.1023.title: "Zaxoid Psionic Concentration Accomplished"
 paradigm_shift.1023.desc: "The Zaxoid Psionic Concentration was a success! The §YZaxoid§! notified us that their operation is back on track."
 # zaxoid task 3
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.3: "Our reserves of §MZro§! are running low. We have detected some traces of it within your borders. We will teach you how to collect and distill it by yourselves. It will require you to allocate some of your scientists to learn and might therefore slow down your technological progress for a bit.\nBased on your intellect, it should take you between 3 and 5 years to learn the basics."
 paradigm_shift_modifier_tasks_zaxoid_3: "Zaxoid Zro Distillation Teachings"

 paradigm_shift.1031.title: "Zaxoid Zro Distillation Teachings"
 paradigm_shift.1031.desc: "Now that the §YZaxoid§! have taught us the basics of §MZro§! distilling, we managed to detect some §MZro§! deposits inside our borders. The §YZaxoid§! have told us to collect it diligently, as they may need it later on."
 paradigm_shift.1031.option: "Very well."
 # zaxoid task 4

 # zaxoid task 5
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.5: "Some of our psionics have detected irregularities around §H[paradigm_shift_target.GetName]§!. It could indicate the breach of a powerful Shroud entity into our realm. You had better be careful."
 paradigm_shift_poi_zaxoid_tasks_5.name: "Suspicious Shroud Activity"
 paradigm_shift_poi_zaxoid_tasks_5.desc: "The Zaxoid have warned us of suspicious Shroud-related activities around §H[paradigm_shift_target.GetName]§!. We should put some of our fleet on standby just in case."
 paradigm_shift.1052.title: "Hostile Shroud Avatar"
 paradigm_shift.1052.desc: "The §YZaxoid§! were right! One gigantic Shroud Avatar appeared over §H[paradigm_shift_target.GetName]§!. What we thought at first to be dust clouds slowly coalesced to form the physical body of the Avatar. Before we could even realize what was going on, it started devouring neighboring ships."
 # Zaxoid task 6
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.6: "We think you should learn more in the field of psionics, and we are willing to tutor your leading scientists. They will, however, need to come to our planet and won't be able to lead your own research in the meantime."
 paradigm_shift_poi_zaxoid_tasks_6.name: "Zaxoid Psionics Teaching"
 paradigm_shift_poi_zaxoid_tasks_6.desc: "The §YZaxoid§! have taken our three research leaders to teach them about psionics."

 paradigm_shift.1062.desc: "Our leaders have come back. They are now experts in psionics and have been working on a way to vulgarize the complex field for the masses."
 paradigm_shift.1062.option: "Wonderful!"
 # Zaxoid task 7
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.7: "Now that you have mastered psionic theory, you are able to help us directly in our guerrilla operations. By concentrating and following our guidance, you will be able to lure Shroud entities to the physical realm. Of course, we will be sure to make them emerge within the borders of the §YKellectors§! and their helpers. It may be a little hard on your population, however, given that interacting with the Shroud is so new to you."
 paradigm_shift_poi_zaxoid_tasks_7.name: "Zaxoid Psionic Concentration"
 paradigm_shift_poi_zaxoid_tasks_7.desc: "We are luring Shroud entities to our realm. They will hopefully disrupt the §YKellectors'§! operations."

 paradigm_shift.1071.desc: "Our population is slowly growing tired of concentrating. We need to use more of our influence to make sure everything continues as planned."
 paradigm_shift.1071.option: "If we must."
 paradigm_shift.1072.title: "Zaxoid Psionic Concentration"
 paradigm_shift.1072.desc: "Our population is becoming quite unhappy with the concentration. They claim that the concentration prevents them from thinking of anything but their task all the time, effectively forbidding them from having any time for themselves."
 paradigm_shift.1072.option: "They must endure."
 paradigm_shift.1073.title: "Zaxoid Psionic Concentration"
 paradigm_shift.1073.desc: "Finally, our concentration has paid off. We sensed the Shroud entities slowly disappearing from our senses. This means that they have left the Shroud and entered our realm. As none of them have been sightened inside our borders, we hope that they emerged inside the Kellectors borders as the §YZaxoid§! planned.\nThis has given us valuable insight for research. Our population is now far happier and the hardships we went through are already forgotten."
 paradigm_shift.1073.option: "The rainbow follows the rain."
 # Zaxoid task 8
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.8: "From a strategic point of view, we should establish a link between our home systems. That way, we will be able to consolidate our fleets faster in case of an enemy attack. We will establish a wormhole terminal at our end, and you must establish your own at your end. The connection will be made automatically, as our Shroud psionic signatures are somewhat similar."

 paradigm_shift.1082.title: "Zaxoid Wormhole Concentration"
 paradigm_shift.1082.desc: "The operation is a success! Slowly, almost imperceptible, the rift formed in front of our eyes. We used the Shroud as a conduit to bend space and force the creation of the wormhole.\nHowever, now that it is formed, we can't perceive any link from it to the Shroud. This makes us wonder if all the wormholes in the galaxy are the result of using the Shroud or if some of them are natural. Regardless, we won't need to spend any resources to keep it open."
 paradigm_shift.1082.option: "Very nice."
# Zaxoid task 9
 paradigm_shift.zaxoid_task.9: "Our enemies seem to have had a similar idea to break our stalemate. Where we technologically elevated pre-FTL civilizations, they built gestalt entities from nothing. From what we can perceive, they seemed afraid of us using psionic powers to turn their creations against them, and have therefore granted them the gift of intelligence. While it hinders us from taking control of them, it also, luckily, makes them far less dangerous.\nMake them know that we know of their pathetic existence."

We need you to administer it to them. Of course, don't allow yourselves to be noticed. You'll need to make it look like a local laboratory made a breakthrough.\nBy the way, our vaccine also contains some nanochips in order for us to study their behaviors.
