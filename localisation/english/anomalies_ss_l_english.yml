 bursted_world_category:0 "Radioactive Planet"
 bursted_world_category_desc:0 "The surface of this planet exhibits strong radioactivity from high levels of unexpectantly high concentrations of short-lived isotopes on the planet. Further investigation is warranted."
 anomaly.10001.name:0 "Blasted Planet"
 anomaly.10001.desc:0 "Within the past 5000 years [Root.GetName]'s entire surface has been blasted with a high-intensity burst of subatomic particles. This has formed radioactive isotopes in a thin layer of topsoil across the planet, owing to a high ambient surface radioactivity. Whether this particle blast came from a supernova explosion, an alien weapon or anything else is open to speculation."
 blasted_planet:0 "Blasted Planet"
 blasted_planet_desc:0 "This planet has been blasted with nuclear particles within the last 5000 years, giving it's surface a layer of radioactive nuclei. The radioactive elements here can be used to produce a large amount of energy."
 
 star_rubbish_dump_category:0 "Unusual Spectral Readings"
 star_rubbish_dump_category_desc:0 "This star exhibits highly unusual spectral scan results. Further investigation requested."
 anomaly.10002.name:0 "Stellar Rubbish Dump"
 anomaly.10002.desc:0 "The unsual spectral readings come from illuminated metallic particles and debris in a low decaying orbit. Our scientists posit these fragments are the result of some sort of rubbish dump, where an ancient civilisation disposed refuse directly onto the star."
 stellar_rubbish_dump:0 "Stellar Rubbish Dump"
 stellar_rubbish_dump_desc:0 "This star was once used as a rubbish dump. A ring of metal particles and fragments sits close the stellar corona and produces interesting spectral continuums.\n\nStudying the metallic fragments may lead to interesting material discoveries."
 
 cold_planet_category:0 "Freezing Planet"
 cold_planet_category_desc:0 "For unknown reasons, this planet is much colder than expected, even though it has an atmosphere. Request for further investigation."
 anomaly.10003.name:0 "Freezing-cold Planet"
 anomaly.10003.desc:0 "A ting layer of aerosols permeate the upper atmosphere of this planet. These aerosols reflect solar radiation and facilitate significant heat loss to outer space. Their artificial nature leads our scientists to conclude these aerosols were added to the atmosphere by another civilisation to cool this already frozen planet to even cooler temperatures.\n\nWhy they would have done this is anyone's guess."
 cold_aerosol:0 "Freezing Aerosols"
 cold_aerosol_desc:0 "Aerosols have been introduced into the atmosphere of this planet. These aerosols reduce the temperature of this planet by reflecting solar radiation back into space. Researching the aerosols can give us a better understanding of planetary geo-engineering."
 
 hot_gas_giant_category:0 "Hot Gas Giant"
 hot_gas_giant_category_desc:0 "This gas giant is rather hot, as if a heat source is been produced from within."
 anomaly.10004.name:0 "Miniature Brown Dwarf"
 anomaly.10004.desc:0 "This gas giant is in fact a small brown dwarf. It appears it's internal pressure is high enough to fuse deuterium and thus a source of energy for the gas giant, causing it to heat up in the process."
 small_brown_dwarf:0 "Small Brown Dwarf"
 small_brown_dwarf_desc:0 "This stellar body is actually a brown dwarf, fusing deuterium in it's core. Studying stellar properties on this scale is a great opportunity for our physicists."
 
 laser_probed_category:0 "Laser Probing"
 laser_probed_category_desc:0 "A device in this asteroid belt is probing our science ship with a laser. It appears to be jamming our attempts to scan it."
 anomaly.10010.name:0 "Automated Defense Platform"
 anomaly.10010.desc:0 "The source of the laser probe is an ancient defence platform hidden in the asteroid field. Remarkably, it is partially functional to this day. Thankfully, it appears to be unable to engage its weapon systems.\n\nOur science vessel has managed to determine that it is designed to fire some sort of guided torpedo. A special project is issued to further study the weapon platform."
 anomaly.10010.opta:0 "Study the weapon platform."
 anomaly.10011.name:0 "Weapon Platform Study Complete"
 anomaly.10011.desc:0 "We have completed the study of the weapons platform. It utilised a torpedo warhead which focuses on overwhelming electrical system with a massive Electromagnetic Pulse.\n\nThese torpedoes should prove to be very effective at depleting shielding systems."
 
 EMP_TORPEDO_PROJECT:0 "Study Automated Torpedo Weapon Platform"
 EMP_TORPEDO_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our science teams have identified an ancient and partially functional torpedo weapon platform. Studying it may reveal insights into its weapon systems."
