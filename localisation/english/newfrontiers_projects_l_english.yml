 GRID_ORBIT_PROJECT:0 "The Giant Grid"
 GRID_ORBIT_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A massive ancient construct was discovered in the upper atmosphere of the brown dwarf, [From.GetName]. Our researchers want to study this structure and find out why it was built."
 DEVOURER_ORBIT_PROJECT:0 "Swallowed by a Dwarf"
 DEVOURER_ORBIT_PROJECT_DESC:0 "One of the system’s major comets is being drawn onto a collision course with [from.GetName]. Our scientists want to record the details of this incredibly rare event."
 ANCIENT_MACHINE_1_PROJECT:0 "The Terraforming Device"
 ANCIENT_MACHINE_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "An ancient terraforming device was discovered on [from.GetName]. Our scientists are confident that they will be able to activate this ancient mechanism."
 ANCIENT_MACHINE_2_PROJECT:0 "Permission to Disassemble the Machine"
 ANCIENT_MACHINE_2_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Despite its age, the mysterious machine found on the surface of [from.GetName] has the potential to be very useful for our researchers. Some of our engineers have asked for permission to disassemble and analyze the device to learn more about this technology."
 EVOLVED_REGULAR_STAR_PROJECT:0 "Stellar Anomaly"
 EVOLVED_REGULAR_STAR_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientists have discovered irregular activity involving [evolved_regular_star.GetName]. They would like to learn more about the nature of this phenomenon."
 EVOLVED_GIANT_STAR_PROJECT:0 "Stellar Anomaly"
 EVOLVED_GIANT_STAR_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientists have discovered irregular activity involving [evolved_giant_star.GetName]. They would like to learn more about the nature of this phenomenon."
 SUPERNOVA_PROJECT:0 "Instable Hypergiant"
 SUPERNOVA_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientists have detected a pronounced instability in the surface of hypergiant [supernova.GetName]. They are convinced that this phenomenon requires immediate attention."
