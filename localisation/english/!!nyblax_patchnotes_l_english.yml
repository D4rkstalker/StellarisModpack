 story_desc: "Latest Update Date: 18/03/2020\n\nThis Patch includes:\n§WGeneral:§!\n§R - Mod now 2.6 compliant.\n - Interdiction war now selects the strongest federation leader to be the interdiction leader and cascades throughout the rest of the empires if rejected.\n - Peace wish now gives actual peace.\n - Invisibility Rune: active modifier from 50% to 25%.\n - Invisibility Rune: Cost from 50 to 100.\n - Reworked some high CPU intense outcomes from the Nyblax Cube to allow lower end PC or higher galaxy settings to not crash upon wishing stuff.\n - Some wishes like: purging, conquering the galaxy or assimilated now have their effect spread recursively from the capital of the wisher so that the effect does not happen all at once and thus reduce the possibility of crashing due to timeout.\n - Replaced on_entering_system with on_entering_system_first_time to help reduce processing power\n - Rewrote some of the outcome flavour text to fit the new mechanics.\n - The Collectors wish now behaves like the cube purge where the purge will spread from the collectors capital to the rest of the galaxy.\n - Fixed ESC now working properly on the first contact with the Collectors.\n - Fixed a weird case where an unintended artifact action would show up.\n - Using the Cube to build a federation now adds 1000 opinion modifier with a decay of 5.§!\n\n§WPrevious:§!\n - You can now Balance the universe using the nyblax cube.\n - Lots of typos, reworked art and other story stuff probably nobody will ever notice lol.\n - The Nyblax Eye no longer provides a basic 20 planetary sensor range, but +1 influence, active is still the same.\n - Added a trigger that checks every year if player has the nyblax cure to heal infested pops in case an infested refugee arrives or other weird scenario.\n - The interdiction no-ai-leave-federation reduced from 20 years to 15 years.\n - Fallen empires will awaken if players fail to stop the mad collector before he gets all the runes.\n - Awekened empires will leave the interdictors as soon as the intercition war ends but will remain awakened (The rest of the empires will have to sort it out on their own).\n - Awakened fallen empires will expand and behave as they do regularely, they wont get any additional fleets tho (Unlike the sleepers awake event chain).\n - The Raiding Planet modifier from the mad collector is now timed based to prevent cases were it could die while raiding and the modifier would be stuck there.\n\nI would like to thank my Patrons for supporting my work!\n\nIf you like my work and would like to support me so I keep on adding content you can do it by becoming a Patron at: §Bhttps://www.patreon.com/hivemods§!"
