 story_desc: "Latest Update Date: 17/01/2020\n\nThis Patch includes:\nGeneral:\n§R - New Midgame Crisis: The Nyblax Plague.\n - Starting at midgame there will be a 33% chance to spawn this crisis (the other 66% are for spacerifts and mad collector).\n - The crisis is triggered when the Collectors try to replicate one of the runes, which infects them with a highly contagious disease.\n - The disease will spread galaxy wide and empire wide, meaning, the more plagued neighbours, federation members, migrations or reaserch agreements you have, the faster it will spread towards your empire.\n - The disease has 6 stages, the 6th one being death.\n - Each stage provides a malus to the pop and the planet.\n - It takes 2 years for a pop to evolve from one stage to the other while it takes 1 year for the disease to spread to other empires or pops.\n\nHow to fight the crisis:\n - As soon as the crisis starts there will be a special project enabled to all playable empires.\n - At 50% of researching the special project, you will contain the disease, no more pops will get sick and the sickness wont get worse in already infected pops.\n - At 100% your pops will be cured.\n - The first empire to find the cure will be rewarded by the Collectors with a unique relic otherwise unattainable.\n - Once an empire gets the cure, it can be bought at the Collectors to fully cure your pops.§!\n\nI hope you like the new crisis! It took me a while to get it right and I guess I will need to buff the new Relic in the future, so let me know what u think about it!\n\nI would like to thank my Patrons for supporting my work!\n\nIf you like my work and would like to support me so I keep on adding content you can do it by becoming a Patron at: §Bhttps://www.patreon.com/hivemods§!"
