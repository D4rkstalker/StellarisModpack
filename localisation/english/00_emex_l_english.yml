 qfts.100.a: "Interesting."
 qfts.101.name: "Tomb Planet"
 qfts.101.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, the crew on the [Root.GetName] spotted an empty, tomb planet orbiting the star. It seems that the co-ordinates from the Shivkonians lead there. \n\n§HSurveying the planet may reveal an anomaly.§!"
 qfts.101.a: "Intriguing."
 qfts.102.name: "Gaia Planet"
 qfts.102.desc: "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, the crew on the [Root.GetName] spotted a lush, gaia planet orbiting the star. Our co-ordinates lead to the planet, so perhaps the Flistonu are still alive?"
 qfts.102.a: "Perhaps we should establish contact."
 qfts.103.name: "Shielded Planet"
 qfts.103.desc: "Upon entering the Shiv system, the home system of the ancient Shivkonians, several odd planets were seen. \n\nApart from the several debris fields and fragmented planets, a mysterious planet, encased in an impenetrable energy shield, was spotted orbiting the crimson star. \n\nA §Hspecial project§! has been prepared to investigate this strange world."
 qfts.103.a: "How peculiar."
 
 qfts.1.name: "The Shivkonian Star Union"
 qfts.1.desc: "Exploring the minor remains of buildings on the surface of the cracked planet has revealed that they were once the base of an observation mission run by an empire referred to as the §YShivkonian Star Union§!. \n\nAccording to the records, which were quite easily translated, the base was stationed several star systems away from the primitive civilisation which they were studying. \n\nFurthermore, some logs mention "planting special genes into the primitives"."
 qfts.1.a: "Could they've been the Seeders?"
 qfts.2.name: "Derelict Station Discovered"
 qfts.2.desc: "Our scientists, using the records and logs from the cracked planet, have found the co-ordinates of a planetary space station in orbit of a barren world. It seems that the station has since long falled into a state of disrepair, and is in a terminal orbit around the barren planet. \n\nA §Hspecial project§! has been prepared to study and explore the station and the planet."
 qfts.2.a: "Interesting."
 qfts.3.name: "Special Project Completed"
 qfts.3.desc: "The team on the derelict station have returned with their expedition. They have managed to retrieve some artifacts and old texts from the station, but they couldn't access certain certain areas of the station. \n\nA full excavation will be needed to access every part of the station."
 qfts.3.a: "Start the excavation."
 qfts.4.name: "Trade Hub"
 qfts.4.desc: "The station seems to have once been some sort of trade hub, owned by the Shivkonian Star Union. In fact, the majority of their trade routes seem to have came here, which provided their star empire with large amounts of trade value and massively contributed to their economy. \n\nOur archaeologists are currently attempting to access a hidden room, blocked off by masses of debris."
 qfts.4.a: "Interesting."
 qfts.5.name: "Station Loans"
 qfts.5.desc: "Due to this trade station, apparently referred to as the §YRaklomia Trade Hub§! by the Shivkonians, providing the majority of the Star Union's energy credits, the observation team from the cracked world requested that they be given some of their credits, as the government was not funding the observation and "planting" process enough for it to be a success. \n\nThe team on the trade hub agreed, as long as the credits be paid back at a later date."
 qfts.5.a: "The "planting" process..."
 qfts.6.name: "The Other Civilisation"
 qfts.6.desc: "Some more texts have been found in the last unexplored area of the Raklomia Trade Hub. It appears that the team on the cracked world never paid back the energy credits that they owed, and the writer of the texts seemed considerably frustrated and angry, stating that "that other observation team would never have done this". \n\nOur archaeologists have also found the co-ordinates of a previously uncharted star system."
 qfts.6.a: "Let's see what's there."
 qfts.7.name: "Eradicated World"
 qfts.7.desc: "[From.From.GetName] was indeed once a home to a species of sapients. This can be seem by the remains of their old civilisation, but what could've happened to them that their entire homeworld was wiped out and turned into a lifeless tomb world? \n\nA excavation project has been prepared to discover the secrets of the planet."
 qfts.7.a: "How odd."
 qfts.8.name: "The Seeded Ones"
 qfts.8.desc: "We have confirmed that the civilisation that once lived on the surface of [From.From.GetName] was the other primitive civilisation that was seeded by the Shivkonian Star Union, or, the Seeders. \n\nHowever, in contrast to us, it seems that the civilisation on this tomb world had mechanical implants of some sort, rather than biological changes like us, to form a Hive Mind."
 qfts.8.a: "Our brethren."
 qfts.9.name: "Spacefarers"
 qfts.9.desc: "According to a number of documents found in some large ruins, the §YFlistonu§! eventually achieved FTL travel, much earlier than we did. The Shivkonians are not mentioned in any of the texts, however. It may be possible that by this time the Shivkonian Star Union fell apart. \n\nFurthermore, we have found evidence that the Flistonu managed to secure a colony somewhere, but not much is known about this colony."
 qfts.9.a: "Where could this colony be?"
 qfts.10.name: "Lost Contact"
 qfts.10.desc: "It seems that the main Mind on the planet somehow lost contact with the drones on their first colony, possibly due to a malfunction in the engineering of the §YMind Unifier§!, as the Flistonu called it. \n\nIt is not known what happened to the Flistonu colony, but the drones on the capital worked hard to find a way to resolve the situation."
 qfts.10.a: "Good thing this didn't happen to us."
 qfts.11.name: "Anarchy"
 qfts.11.desc: "When the researchers and engineers of the §YFlistonu Organism§! attempted to restablish communications with their colony and repair the mind-link between the colonisers and the Mind, a major issue occurred. \n\nThe entire Mind Unifier was deactivated, presumably by accident, and every single drone on the world became independent and capable of free thought. Decades of being extensions of the Mind had scarred the newly free Flistonu, and many had an existential crisis. However, most rioted and chaos filled the world. \n\nEventually, the entire planet was engulfed in conflict, and the result was the extinction of the Flistonu species and the death of the planetary flora and fauna. \n\nOur researchers are interested in finding this colony of theirs, so many have decided to remain on the planet to study whatever they can find. They estimate it'll be §H5 years§! until they're done."
 qfts.11.a: "Disturbing."
 qfts.12.name: "Finding the Colony"
 qfts.12.desc: "After several years of researching and studying the tomb world, which was once the homeworld of the Flistonu, our scientists have prepared a §Hspecial project§! to find the colony mentioned in several of the texts and documents found on the planet. \n\nIt will take a lot of time and resources, but it will unravel the secrets of the Flistonu."
 qfts.12.a: "Understood."
 qfts.13.name: "Special Project Completed"
 qfts.13.desc: "After months of using our knowledge of the Flistonu and the records on their ancient homeworld, our scientists believe they have successfully found the colony. \n\nA previously uncharted star system has been marked in the §Hsituation log§!."
 qfts.13.a: "Onwards."
 qfts.14.name: "The Flistonu Democratic Republic"
 qfts.14.desc: "It has been confirmed that the gaia planet is indeed populated by many Flistonu. \n\nAlthough they seem to have quite primitive technology, they are hailing us."
 qfts.14.a: "On screen."
 qfts.15.name: "Flistonu Democratic Republic"
 qfts.15.desc: "Well met, [Species.GetNamePlural]. We are the Flistonu, and this is our lush homeworld: New Flistonia."
 qfts.15.a: "Are you our brothers?"
 qfts.15a.response: "I'm sorry? Brothers? \n\nYou say you were "seeded" by a species, which may have been called the Shivkonians? Yes... This sounds familiar. \n\nWe were once like you: a Hive Mind, all united for one purpose, yet, disunited by the lack of freedom. But shortly after colonsing this planet, we lost contact with the main Mind on Flistonia, and all Flistonu were free. \n\nWe never found out what happened to our old homeworld, but we assumed the worst."
 qfts.15.b: "What did you do after becoming free?"
 qfts.15b.response: "Lucky for us, the colony was still relatively new, so not too many Flistonu caused riots and protests. \n\nIt took everyone awhile to get used to being capable of free thought and the freedom to do things on their own, but the makeshift government at the time assisted those that struggled with this sudden change. \n\nEventually, we started building up our new home, but it was a real struggle without the technology of our old homeworld, as well as the knowledge that was preserved in the Mind."
 qfts.15.c: "Tell us about this world."
 qfts.15c.response: "New Flistonia was originally a tropical world, filled with flora and fauna. Although our species was more suited to a continental climate, we managed to make do. \n\nAfter decades of research, we discovered how to terraform the planet into a paradise."
 #qfts.15.d: "Your armies are... odd."
 #qfts.15d.response: "Ah yes, that's because they are Psionic Entities; entities made of pure pyschic energy, here on our planet thanks to the Shroud. \n\nWhat is the Shroud, you ask? Well, it is a dimension of pure pyschic energy, and can be accessed through psionic powers of individuals. \n\nOur species transcended to the Shroud quite recently, but we have managed to receive several boons and benefits from it. \n\nUnfortunately, hive minded individuals cannot enter the Shroud."
 qfts.15.e: "That will be all."
 qfts.15e.response: "Hold on! If we are truly brothers, then we must be united and cordial to each other, even if one is still a Hive Mind. \n\nLet us help you in technological advancements and show you what New Flistonia has to offer."
 qfts.16.name: "New Flistonia Invaded"
 qfts.16.desc: "Our forces have managed to defeat the Flistonu forces on their gaia homeworld of New Flistonia. But just as our armies were returning into the planet's orbit, something happened. \n\nThe entirety of the once-lush planet became enveloped in nanites. The scenery is no longer visible; these nanoactuators cover the whole world. \n\nWhat actually happened to the population of Flistonu on the planet is unknown, but it is speculated that they too were made of nanites."
 qfts.16.a: "Disconcerting."
 qfts_fix.18.name: "Flistonu Exposed"
 qfts_fix.18.desc: "On a bi-yearly visit to the Flistonu's capital city, our envoys noticed something odd about the Flistonu. \n\nWhen the lead Flistonu went to wave off our envoys, their left arm dissipated into millions of nanoscopic particles. As they look at their body to see what happened, more and more of their body began to fade away into gray nanoparticles. \n\nAfter examination, we have concluded that the Flistonu were not living beings; instead, they were made up of millions of rapidly-replicating nanites. It seems that every single member of their society is made up of nanites."
 qfts_fix.18.a: "§RThey must be destroyed!§!"
 qfts_fix.18.b: "They are still our brothers. Hail them."
 qfts_fix.19.name: "Flistonu Democratic Republic"
 qfts_fix.19.desc: "[Species.GetNamePlural]... We must thank you. \n\nI apologise for hiding our origins from you. You must understand that previous encounters with monoforms did not end well. We were simply protecting ourselves. \n\nBut it seems we misjudged you. You have shown us that not all monoforms are the same. \n\nTo repay you, let us aid you in your search for the Seeders. We may not be the original Flistonu, but we retain their ancient knowledge."
 qfts_fix.19.a: "We must stay united."
 qfts_fix.20.name: "New Flistonia Investigation"
 qfts_fix.20.desc: "After analysing the nanite-covered surface of New Flistonia, our archaeologists are keen on beginning a closer investigation into the Flistonu and their former planet. \n\nIt will be difficult to conduct the excavation from orbit, but landing onto the planet could prove dangerous."
 qfts_fix.20.a: "Start digging."
 qfts.21.name: "Excavation Halted"
 qfts.21.desc: "After several days in orbit of the nanite world, our archaeologists and scientists have not made much progress. All that was discovered is that the entirety of the world is indeed covered in nanites, only confirming our previous ideas. \n\nAllowing the archaeologists to land on the surface would allow for a quicker excavation, but it would take a lot of resources and coersion to get our archaeologists to land, and even then, it would be dangerous."
 qfts.21.a: "Send down a landing team."
 qfts.21.b: "Stay in orbit."
 qfts.22.name: "Drowning Tower"
 qfts.22.desc: "After much time, a massive tower has been discovered on the planet's surface. It is constantly being flooded in nanites, and the building is unstable. \n\nIf we do not act soon, there is no doubt that the building would come toppling down."
 qfts.22.a: "Intriguing."
 qfts.23.name: "Secret Vault"
 qfts.23.desc: "After our archaeologists explored the grand tower, they did not manage to find anything of interest. \n\nJust when the mission was going to be called a failure, a massive swarm of nanites broke through one of the walls, flooding the entire room. As the excavation team panicked and attempted to escape the rapidly approaching wave of nanobots, one of our archaeologists accidentally stepped on a camouflaged pressure plate. \n\nA portion of the ground was moved, and a large staircase leading to a room underground was revealed. After quickly shutting the entrance behind them, a locked vault was found."
 qfts.23.a: "We need to crack the vault."
 qfts.24.name: "Flistonu Remnants"
 qfts.24.desc: "The vault was finally cracked by our archaeologists, and inside were piles of ancient artifacts, along with many texts and documents. \n\nThe texts were written in the Flistonu language, and they revealed that this vault once belonged to the leader of the makeshift government, established to restore order and peace to the planet. \n\nAccording to texts, the government tried to reason with the population, but to no avail. Despite their best attempts, the planet was engulfed in chaos, and was doomed to the same fate as their old homeworld. \n\nThe dead Flistonu body we found nearby seems to be the corpse of the leader of the makeshift government. It is likely that they hid in this vault alone, and eventually died of starvation."
 qfts.24.a: "A sad tale."
 qfts.25.name: "Deceptive Planet"
 qfts.25.desc: "Earlier today, an asteroid approached the frozen world [seeder_colony.GetName]. As the asteroid collided with the planet's surface, it suddenly disappeared, causing no damage. It did, however, cause odd lights to appear on the planet's surface. \n\nIt would seem that the planet's surface is not actually the surface; rather, the frozen landscape (which many have regarded as odd, being so close to its star) is a projection from somewhere on the world, and [seeder_colony.GetName]'s true landscape is hidden below the false surface. \n\nA §Hspecial project§! has been prepared to survey the planet's true surface."
 qfts.25.a: "Interesting."
 qfts.26.name: "Special Project Completed"
 qfts.26.desc: "The deceptive planet is covered in ruined buildings and complexes, once towering over the entire world and housing billions of inhabitants. It is clear that the false projection has been active for a long time, given the fact that the once-great ecumenopolis has been reduced to rubble. \n\nBut why was the planet hidden from the rest of the galaxy? An archaeological site has been prepared to find out why."
 qfts.26.a: "Odd."
 qfts.27.name: "Ancient Colony"
 qfts.27.desc: "This world was indeed once an ecumenopolis; a city-planet of some sort. \n\nIt seemed to be extremely advanced, even without the fact that the entire landscape was encased in metal, but the owner of the planet, and why it was hidden remains a mystery."
 qfts.27.a: "Keep digging."
 qfts.28.name: "Foundry Arcologies"
 qfts.28.desc: "The planet was a crucial colony for whatever empire owned it. The surface was littered with dozens of gargantuan arcologies, producing mass amounts of alloys and goods for the population. \n\nThe partially converted industrial arcologies and masses of alloys suggest that the planet was focused on producing alloys, towards the end of the planet's inhabitation, at least. We have also managed to retrieve some alloys from the great stockpiles on the planet."
 qfts.28.a: "Interesting."
 qfts.29.name: "The Great War"
 qfts.29.desc: "The owner of this world seems to have been engulfed in a major war, which they called the §YGreat War of Ethics§!. Many of the leisure districts and commercial zones on the planet that once stretched across its surface were replaced by military academies and recruitment centres. \n\nIt is unclear who the opposing empire was."
 qfts.29.a: "Intriguing."
 qfts.30.name: "Civil War"
 qfts.30.desc: "Assisted by the familiar texts, our archaeologists have concluded that this world was a colony belonging to the §YShivkonian Star Union§!. \n\nThe Great War previously mentioned was fought between two factions of Shivkonians, after a sudden shift away from egalitarianism. The new authoritarian regime angered much of the population, and sparked a sudden civil war. The freedom fighters fought against the newly named §YShivkonian Star Regime§!, but the result of the war remains unknown."
 qfts.30.a: "Keep digging."
 qfts.31.name: "Mysterious Disappearances"
 qfts.31.desc: "Although what side owned the planet during the course of the Great War of Ethics is unknown, it is clear that the population of the planet were subject to heavy orbital bombardment, before the population suddenly... disappeared. \n\nOur archaeologists suggest that a mass evacuation took place, but no evidence was found that leads to such a conclusion. \n\nEither way, after decades of neglect, the once-vibrant ecumenopolis crumbled and became what it is now. It is gone; reduced to atoms."

 qfts.32.desc: "After finding enough remnants and relics from the Shivkonian Star Union's reign over this portion of the galaxy, our scientists have managed to find the location of §YShiv§!, the home system and capital of the Shivkonian Star Union, and their successor, the Star Regime. \n\nA previously uncharted star system has been marked in the §Hsituation log§!."
 qfts.32.a: "Onwards."
 qfts.33.name: "Special Project Completed"
 qfts.33.desc: "After analysing Shivka Prime and its two moons closely, our researchers believe that they have found where the shield encasing the entire world is coming from. \n\nIt seems that a beam of near-invisible light is being projected from somewhere on the barren moon of §YNitrel§!. An excavation of the moon has been prepared."
 qfts.33.a: "Start digging."
 qfts.34.name: "Grand Complex"
 qfts.34.desc: "After searching the cold, barren surface of Nitrel for days, our archaeologists have finally found what they believe to be the generator of the shield surrounding Shivka Prime. \n\nThe massive complex of rooms and buildings tower high over the dry landscape, and the very top of the building is pointing at the shielded world. \n\nHowever, there is no way to enter the complex, at least not from where they are."
 qfts.34.a: "Then make an entrance."
 qfts.35.name: "Secret Base"
 qfts.35.desc: "After successfully detonating explosives near weak points in the complex's walls, the archaeologists have managed to enter the grand building. \n\nIn the first room they entered, several documents written in the Shivkonian language were discovered. Apparently, this complex was a secret base, belonging to the egalitarian faction in the war. The egalitarians knew that the Shivkonian Star Regime had massive fleets, so they decided to ruin their economy and stability, rather than their military. \n\nWhether this meant shielding the homeworld of the Shivkonians or not is unknown."
 qfts.35.a: "Enticing. Keep digging!"
 qfts.36.name: "Generator Room"
 qfts.36.desc: "Our archaeologists have managed to reach a room with a massive generator, most likely the generator that is powering the weapon that is creating the shield around Shivka Prime. \n\nFurthermore, a few hastily-written texts were found nearby, mentioning firing the "global pacifier", as they called it, at the planet, with the other base on Varnolk too. This way, it was twice as less likely that the shield will ever come down."
 qfts.36.a: "Well, it is still there..."
 qfts.37.name: "Destruction of Varnolk"
 qfts.37.desc: "Somehow, the second rebel base on Varnolk was destroyed, along with the entire moon. The few documents found mentioning the Star Regime's secret weapon are scribbled, and are difficult to make out. \n\nHowever, the very same texts mention the location of the shield generator in the base, as the Shivkonians at the base decided to hide the location of the weapon, in the hopes that it will never be found."
 qfts.37.a: "Interesting."
 qfts.38.name: "Unshielding of Shivka Prime"
 qfts.38.desc: "With the location of the planetary shield generator on Nitrel found, we can now deactivate the energy shield active on Shivka Prime. \n\nAs our archaeologists saw the crimson lever, they pulled it down with a loud clank. \n\nThe energy shield began to dissipate, and the planet's surface was revealed. A lush, gaia world, but is it just another nanite world, like with the Flistonu? Our archaeologists are eager to find out."
 qfts.38.a: "No turning back now."
 qfts.39.name: "Shivkonian Homeworld"
 qfts.39.desc: "Unlike New Flistonia, Shivka Prime is indeed a true gaia world, but what is more interesting is the millions of dead bodies and ruined buildings; what happened here? \n\nPerhaps chaos broke out upon the world being encased, but the massive craters and undetonated bombs suggests otherwise..."
 qfts.39.a: "Keep digging."
 qfts.40.name: "The Colossus Project"
 qfts.40.desc: "To fight back against the egalitarian faction in the civil war, the Shivkonian Star Regime decided to prepare a weapon of an unimagineable scale, capable of destroying worlds. This mission was dubbed the Colossus Project, and hundreds of scientists and engineers got to work, devising a massive hull and the great weapon for the ship. \n\nThe phrase "world cracker" is mentioned several times throughout the texts found regarding the project."
 qfts.40.a: "Disturbing."
 qfts.41.name: "The Neutron Sweep"
 qfts.41.desc: "The Colossus ship, armed with a world cracker weapon, was constructed relatively quickly, and its test-fire target was Varnolk, which just so happened to be one of the rebel bases. If the Star Regime knew about the egalitarian base on the moon, they did not mention it in their documents. \n\nThe Shivkonians realised just how wasteful the world cracker is, especially if it was used on one of their former colonies. Instead, the Colossus was later fitted with a "neutron sweep", a weapon that "paints" a planet with neutrons and kills all organic life. \n\nAfter discovering the egalitarians' main source of alloys, the Star Regime decided to utilise the Colossus on an actual target: Krobak, the ancient ecumenopolis we located several star systems away."
 qfts.41.a: "Intriguing."
 qfts.42.name: "Victory for the Regime"
 qfts.42.desc: "Not much is known about what occurred after Krobak was swept of all life. However, it seems that the Shivkonian Star Regime were the victors of the war, and the loyal population threw a massive celebration, and the day came to be known as National Victory Day. \n\nLater on, however, more and more of the population began to grow tired and angry because of the Grand Marshal's rule. The dictator knew of this, and wanted a way to ensure total obedience from all citizens of the regime."
 qfts.42.a: "Keep digging."
 qfts.43.name: "The Seedings"
 qfts.43.desc: "The Grand Marshal's best scientists devised a way to ensure total obedience from the population: by working out a way to connect everyone's minds to the dictator's, he would, effectively, have total control over the lives of everyone, like a Hive Mind. \n\nThe Grand Marshal approved this idea, and two research teams were formed, one of which used a mechanical way to form a Hive Mind, on the Flistonu, and the other used genetic engineering, on our species. \n\nAccording to the dictator's closest advisor, the Grand Marshal was paranoid about the genetic method, as there were rumours saying that the neural link of all those involved would eventually dissipate."
 qfts.43.a: "Could this be true?"
 qfts.44.name: "The Hive"
 qfts.44.desc: "In the end, the Grand Marshal, now the Great Mind, decided to use the mechanical way, possibly due to the rumours about the genetic method, but also because it seems that we did not show signs of forming a gestalt consciousness when we were first seeded. \n\nAfter the mechanical implants were forced into everyone's heads, the research team on our homeworld left, leaving us all alone. \n\nAll that is known is that the Shivkonian Star Regime became the Shivkonian Star Hive. The eventual downfall of the Shivkonians is unknown, as is the loss of the egalitarians."
 qfts.44.a: "We may never know the entire truth."
 qfts.45.name: "The Shivkonians: The End"
 qfts.45.desc: "And thus, our great journey to discover the seeders is at an end. \n\nThe seeders, or the Shivkonians, may no longer be with us now, but their gift to us was unity. They may have not been as united as we are, but we owe our great consciousness to them. \n\nIt is true that many questions have been left unanswered: why did the egalitarian faction fall? What are the nanite beings on New Flistonia and why are they acting as the Flistonu? How did the Shivkonian Star Hive, inevitably, collapse? What happened to the Great Mind of the Hive? We may never know the truth. \n\nHowever, we did manage to retrieve the master neural implant, used by the Great Mind. Why it was left alone is not known, but it is in decent conditon, considering its age, and although we may not be able to utilise its maximum potential, we might be able to gain some insights from the ancient Shivkonians. \n\nMany are confused and afraid of some of the revelations made on Shivka Prime; they fear that our neural link with one another is weakening, and our fate will ultimately be one very similar to that of our ancient brothers, the Flistonu. Researchers are keen on ensuring that we remain united, and are attempting to find new methods to ensure the integrity of our neural link."
 qfts.45.a: "Perhaps the reward was the discoveries we made along the way."
 qfts.47.desc: "After using up masses of energy, the Shivkonian Mechanical Consciousness has been activated, and we have managed to retrieve an interesting insight from the time of the Shivkonians. \n\nThis particular data fragment is about genetics, and how the Shivkonians utilised their advancements in the field to masterfully genetically engineer their species, as well as seed ours."
 qfts.48.desc: "After using up masses of energy, the Shivkonian Mechanical Consciousness has been activated, and we have managed to retrieve an interesting insight from the time of the Shivkonians. \n\nThis particular data fragment is about industry, and how the Shivkonians utilised their advancements in the field to masterfully transform their colonies, as well as seed the Flistonu."
 qfts.49.desc: "After using up masses of energy, the Shivkonian Mechanical Consciousness has been activated, and we have managed to retrieve an interesting insight from the time of the Shivkonians. \n\nThis particular data fragment is about how the Hive fought deviancy and ensured stability on its colonies, both before the species was forced into a Hive Mind, and after."
 qfts.50.desc: "After using up masses of energy, the Shivkonian Mechanical Consciousness has been activated, and we have managed to retrieve an interesting insight from the time of the Shivkonians. \n\nThis particular data fragment is about war, and how the Shivkonians managed to focus their economy on war and the construction of ships in times of need."
 qfts.51.desc: "After using up masses of energy, the Shivkonian Mechanical Consciousness has been activated, and we have managed to retrieve an interesting insight from the time of the Shivkonians. \n\nWe have managed to retrieve a data fragment about the unifying of the Hive Mind, as well as methods of forcing the Mind's will onto the drones. This will surely help us with keeping our consciousness united."

 plasoc.1000.desc: "Our scientists have finished phase one of the vaccine testing. \n\nPhase one of vaccine testing involved testing the vaccine on an extremely small group of [Species.GetNamePlural], perhaps even only half a dozen. This helped to rule out major safety problems and helped doctors work out to correct dose for the next phase. \n\nTo continue our research, we need to establish a group to regulate the vaccine and watch for any negative developments that may occur.

 plasoc.1000.a: "Good."
 plasoc.1001.name: "Phase Two Complete"

 plasoc.32.name: "Giant Fissure"
 plasoc.32.desc: "Upon landing on [terror_base.GetName], our archaeologists could not spot anything out of the ordinary on the world, and there are no traces of any building, nor ship, ever existing. \n\nThe archaeologists began to doubt anything was actually on the world, and they suspected that the signal sent to the world was a decoy. \n\nHowever, as the crew were returning back to the science ship, a massive crevice was found, leading into the depths of [terror_base.GetName]. Nothing can be seen, apart from darkness, but there is nothing else on the planet that can be found."
 plasoc.32.a: "It must lead somewhere."
 plasoc.33.name: "Underground Maze"
 plasoc.33.desc: "After successfully and safely reaching the bottom of the massive pit, several caves were found, all seeming to lead to different areas. At first glance, our archaeologists thought it would take months to fully explore all of the tunnels, but many either led to the same destination or to nowhere. \n\nHowever, several lead to a larger room, blocked off by a giant wall made of some sort of metal. Attempts to penetrate the wall have so far proved useless, but other methods are currently being tested."
 plasoc.33.a: "There has to be a way."
 plasoc.34.name: "Entering the Base"
 plasoc.34.desc: "The grand wall, after discovering several weak points, was obliterated with targeted and controlled explosions, revealing a group of people in a dark blue uniform, armed with plasma blasters. \n\nThanks to the archaeologists' skill and the assistance of a minor military force, the enemy forces were defeated, but we suspect that more are dwelling within the complex of tunnels. \n\nAlthough it is not yet confirmed, the tunnel complex seems to lead to the base of the terrorist group that attacked our homeworld several times."

 plasoc.35.name: "Attack Plans"
 plasoc.35.desc: "As the crew gradually explored the mazes deep below the surface of [terror_base.GetName], several terrorists were found, in the same uniform. Many were armed, and offered some resistance, but the majority fled once they recognised our forces. \n\nEventually, a large room was found, filled with diagrams, documents and plans. From the texts, we can see that several attacks were planned to be carried out previously, but were cancelled, for some unknown reason."
 plasoc.35.a: "Keep exploring."
 plasoc.36.name: "Subterranean Shipyard"
 plasoc.36.desc: "Our archaeologists found a truely massive room underground, with the ceiling being tens of miles above the ground. In fact, it seems that the ceiling is a fake one, composed of metal, but covered with materials to make it look natural from the surface. A system of machines suggest that the ceiling can be opened and closed at will. \n\nFurthermore, scraps of metal and engineering equipment was found, as well as several half-finished vessels. Presumably, this was some sort of subterranean shipyard, but has since been abandoned, most likely when they received the signal sent by the flagship. \n\nOne vessel in particular stands out, as it is both the only one there which is fully constructed and much larger than the other ships."
 plasoc.36.a: "Investigate."
 plasoc.37.name: "Escape Plan"
 plasoc.37.desc: "After investigating the strange vessel found in the underground shipyard, we have concluded that the ship was meant to transport the majority of the terrorist forces on [terror_base.GetName] to somewhere else, allowing their legacy to live on. Whether the rest of the terrorists would also come is unknown, but the ship was stocked up on fuel and is filled to the brim with resources and documents. \n\nAccording to a piece of paper found, the escape plan was to be carried out around two days before our research team entered the complex of mazes, but was postponed after a group on the planet rioted against the leader, and destroyed some of their research. Soon afterwards, we arrived, so they cancelled the plan altogether, instead escaping in small numbers however they could. \n\nAlthough much of the texts found are either scribbled out, ripped or burnt, a few lines could be made out from the document placed on the captain's desk: "...and soon their empire will be no more... a new empire will... rise from its ashes... A test has just been... on their homeworld... we will see what happens... The Second Coming is nigh..."\n\nWe have also found some sort of machine, which seems to be a partially working §YDNA Engine§! of some sorts. It will be able to provide many benefits to our genetics department if we can get it working."

We will carefully devise and execute a plan to safely integrate a hyperintelligent intelligence to the already established framework. Properly doing so and preparing for all possible outcomes will take many years. Phase 2 will begin when the order to continue our megastructure at [master_ai_origin.GetName] is given.
