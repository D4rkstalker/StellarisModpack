    fatalf_anomaly.101.title:0 "A Hidden Bunker"
    fatalf_anomaly.101.desc:0 "The rock formation, upon closer examination, was actually a large underground bunker within the ground of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It will take some time, but we should be able to find an entrance and explore inside if we wish."
    fatalf_anomaly.001.title:0 "A Hidden Bunker"
    fatalf_anomaly.001.desc:0 "As [Root.GetLeaderName] explores the bunker, they find a single large room filled with antiquated computers and counting machines. Suddenly, a series of wailing alarms begin going off, and all the machines light up.  believes that they may be able to stop whatever is happening, but there is still time to flee."
    fatalf_anomaly.002.title:0 "A Hidden Bunker"
    fatalf_anomaly.002.desc:0 "A quick examination of the bunker reveals that each machine is part of an alarm system that activated when we entered the bunker. [Root.GetLeaderName] was able to find a machine to destroy to stop the system, which they discover would have set off numerous explosives, decimating the area."
    fatalf_anomaly.003.title:0 "A Hidden Bunker"
    fatalf_anomaly.003.desc:0 "A quick examination of the bunker reveals that each machine is part of an alarm system that activated when we entered the bunker. However, [Root.GetLeaderName] was unable to find a way to deactivate the wailing sirens. Just as they realize their work is futile, the entire bunker and surrounding landscape explode in a great fireball. It is unlikely anyone or anything survived."
    fatalf_anomaly.004.title:0 "A Hidden Bunker"
    fatalf_anomaly.004.desc:0 "Whatever the cause, it can't be good. Your team moves as fast as they can and retreats from the bunker. Just as they begin to leave the planet, the bunker and the surrounding landscape go up in a giant fireball. Anyone caught in that would have no chance of surviving."
    fatalf_anomaly.005.title:0 "An Abandoned Station"
    fatalf_anomaly.005.desc:0 "We have found an abandoned space station located in orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It had a rudimentary form of cloaking that disguised it from our sensors, but dissipated as we approached. There are no obvious signs of life, other than large gashes through the metal located all over the station."
    fatalf_anomaly.006.title:0 "An Abandoned Station"
    fatalf_anomaly.006.desc:0 "Whatever caused those terrible marks is long gone, as the station is empty with not a single sign of life, current or previous. Everything of use within has been removed. However, the station itself may provide some useful technology, primitive though it may be."
    fatalf_anomaly.007.title:0 "An Abandoned Station"
    fatalf_anomaly.007.desc:0 "As it turns out, the station was not as empty as we had hoped. The inside was filled with long-dead corpses of some unknown roach-like creature. Their bodies were mutilated almost beyond recognition. Unfortunately, the automated defenses that killed them were still operational, and were set off as your team ventured further inside. There were no survivors."
    fatalf_anomaly.008.title:0 "An Abandoned Station"
    fatalf_anomaly.008.desc:0 "As it turns out, the station was not as empty as we had hoped. The inside was filled with long-dead corpses of some unknown roach-like creature. Their bodies were mutilated almost beyond recognition. The automated defenses that killed them were still operational, but your team was able to find controls to turn them off before the systems could catch them. The station is now as safe as can be."
    fatalf_anomaly.009.title:0 "A Cloaked Asteroid"
    fatalf_anomaly.009.desc:0 "Closer inspection reveals that the empty region of space is infact an asteroid that has been modified with a primitive form of cloaking. Other than that, the asteroid seems absolutely uninteresting."
    fatalf_anomaly.010.title:0 "Absolutely Nothing"
    fatalf_anomaly.010.desc:0 "Closer inspection of the empty region of space reveals that it is truly, completely empty. It is entirely devoid of any trace molecules and background radiation."
    fatalf_anomaly.011.title:0 "A Wormhole Generator"
    fatalf_anomaly.011.desc:0 "Examination of the landscape reveals multiple large machines connected together. They appear to be siphoning energy from some unknown place and emitting radiation patterns similar to those found in a wormhole. We can either leave it running, doing whatever it is currently doing, or we can try to activate it's full potential."
    fatalf_anomaly.012.title:0 "A Wormhole Generator"
    fatalf_anomaly.012.desc:0 "While the design is nothing like we have ever seen before, we were able to mostly understand how to operate the machines. Allocating more power to the siphons provided just the boost the system needed to produce a stable wormhole in §Y[Root.System.GetName]§!!"
    fatalf_anomaly.013.title:0 "Broken Wormhole Generators"
    fatalf_anomaly.013.desc:0 "Examination of the landscape reveals multiple ruined machines that were connected together. From what we can gather their purpose was to siphon energy from some unknown place and stockpile it to produce a stable wormhole. Unfortunately, it is in such a state of disrepair that it is unlikely we would be able to start it again."
    fatalf_anomaly.014.title:0 "Starlight Message"
    fatalf_anomaly.014.desc:0 "Examination of the [From.GetName]'s strange photon emmissions shows that the pattern is not entirely random. The millisecond-long blocks of light occur in three lengths, which translate to a trinary representation of the first 23 fibbonaci numbers, repeated twice a second."
    fatalf_anomaly.015.title:0 "Luminal Graveyard"
    fatalf_anomaly.015.desc:0 "Within the photosphere of [From.GetName] are millions of what appear to be large sheets of an unknown metal. They are being propelled by an unknown force at absurd speeds within the star itself, causing the repeated strobing we observed. We have no idea as to the purpose or origin of the metals."

    fatalf_anomaly.016.title:0 "Transmitting Obelisk"
    fatalf_anomaly.016.desc:0 "When [Root.GetLeaderName] approaches the obelisk, their instruments can faintly detect the remnants of a long-range radio signal. They determine that there is some power source within the pillar, and it was most likely used to transmit information before it was knocked down."
    fatalf_anomaly.017.title:0 "Beautiful Obelisk"
    fatalf_anomaly.017.desc:0 "As [Root.GetLeaderName] gets closer to the fallen obelisk, they can see that it is covered in pictures of beautiful landscapes, many of which would not be possible on this single planet. Under each one is a sentence in some alien language. Though without more to research, we may never know what exactly they say."

    hidden_bunker_fatalf_category:0 "Shapen Landscape"
    hidden_bunker_fatalf_category_desc:0 "There is a strange formation of rock jutting out from the landscape located on §Y[From.GetName]§!. It appears highly unnatural. We should investigate."
    orbiting_station_fatalf_category:0 "An Forgotten Signal"
    orbiting_station_fatalf_category_desc:0 "There is a signal coming from a seemingly empty region of space in the orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. If we take a careful survey, we may be able to find the source."
    empty_asteroid_space_fatalf_category:0 "Empty Space"
    empty_asteroid_space_fatalf_category_desc:0 "Within the asteroid field, your sensors pick up some completely empty space. Most of the system has at least some residual heat or trace molecules, which makes this spot quite interesting."
    wormhole_generator_fatalf_category:0 "Strange Machines"
    wormhole_generator_fatalf_category_desc:0 "Your sensors are detecting some strange readings coming from §Y[From.GetName]§!. They seems similar to those extruded by a natural wormhole, except this is located within the ground."
    pulsating_star_fatalf_category:0 "The Blinking Star"
    pulsating_star_fatalf_category_desc:0 "The star [From.GetName] is not emitting its light in an expected manner. Something is interfering, causing the light to be blocked for milliseconds at a time, mimicking a strobe effect."

    rosetta_stone_fatalf_category:0 "An Obelisk"
    rosetta_stone_fatalf_category_desc:0 "On the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!, your scientist has picked up what appears to be an enormous pillar-shaped object laying flat on the land. They will need to land to get a closer look."

    fatalf_study_colony_wormhole:0 "Examine the Closed Wormhole"
    fatalf_study_colony_wormhole_DESC:0 "Our Scientist disappeared into a spontaneous wormhole and came back with a tale of a great, free planet perfect for our species. If we concentrate our efforts, we may be able to temporarily stabilize the wormhole to travel through. However, we have little time before we lose our chance."
    fatalf_colony_colony_ship:0 "Send the Expeditionary Force"
    fatalf_colony_colony_ship_DESC:0 "The wormhole is mostly stable for the time being. We will probably only have one chance to send our colony ships through before it closes behind us. If it does, it is extremely likely that the resulting energy release will obliterate anything within the system."
    fatalf_stable_wormhole:0 "The Stationary Wormhole"
    fatalf_wormhole_generator_project:0 "Study the Wormhole Generator"
    fatalf_wormhole_generator_project_DESC:0 "We have discovered a functioning wormhole generator on a nearby planet. If we study the machines, we may be able to stabilize a functional wormhole in the system."
    FATALF_BUNKER_STUDY:0 "Study the Shapen Landscape"
    FATALF_BUNKER_STUDY_DESC:0 "There is a large formation of rock that appears highly unnatural located on §Y[From.GetName]§!. We should send someone to investigate it."

    fatalf_stable_wormhole_title:0 "The Stationary Wormhole"
    fatalf_stable_wormhole_desc:0 "It doesn't look like this wormhole is going to be moving again and our scans show it is safe to travel through. Once we do, will we find those we lost?"

    overgrowth_hangar:0 "Overgrowth Hangar"
    d_fatalf_overgrowth:0 "Infectious Overgrowth"
    d_fatalf_overgrowth_desc:0 "We should clear this out before it spreads any more."
