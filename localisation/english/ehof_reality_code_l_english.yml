The ship's propulsion drive collapsed and it laid dormant for exactly 6 hours.\n\nThankfully, the secondary power core did not get damaged and activated shortly after the energy flash, securing the life support system of the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§!.\n\n6 hours after the initial flash, bizarre events began to take place onboard the vessel. The crew reports describe how all the systems began to reactivate, but remained uncontrollable. The monitors inside the ship began to display enigmatic but ordered patterns.\n\nIt was as if the ship was being possessed. Automatic doors closed and opened in a pattern, synchronous to the one on the monitors.\n\n6 more hours passed and the ship's systems collapsed again, but this time entirely, including the secondary power core. At first, this seemed to be the end of the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§!, but the blackout lasted only 10 seconds, after which the vessels systems began to reactivate.\n\nAfter the event, the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§! was back under control and the crew began to examine the vessel, only to find that it was entirely unharmed.\n\nThe $ehof_eps$ have not manifested since and the ships log has no record of this strange 12 hours period, as if nothing happened at all.\n\nThis phenomenon must be investigated further"

The code sequence is capable of infecting and possessing logical structures, like vessels.\n\nThe energy intensity of the code sequence leads to the revelation that the blackout on §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§! was not the result of the vessel being hit by the energy flash, the ship simply could not handle the immense complexity of the information, leading to a full blackout.\n\nThe sequence was in fact responsible for the strange behavior on the ship, including the manifestation of the code sequence itself, as visual information on the monitors or mechanical information with the doors.\n\nThe initial use of the sequence and what it is even supposed to mean is unclear, but we were able to modify our science ships with $ehof_closed_modular$ and $ehof_ep$ scanners.\n\nThe $ehof_closed_modular$ are small, independently powered complexes, located in essential areas of our vessels and will function even after a full blackout of the main and secondary power cores. They are equipped with the ability to connect to specific sections of the ship and reactivate, while entirely cutting them from the main systems. With these complexes the ships will be able to operate again within an hour.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners, like the $ehof_closed_modular$ are also independently powered and are equipped with experimental information processing units, specifically designed for the $ehof_ep$. They will be able to retrieve the pattern and process it, without suffering from the blackout.\n\nWith this new technology, our science ships can now traverse the $ehof_cohesive$ systems safely and are ready for another transmission of the $ehof_ep$."

When the manned unit has reached the end of the tunnel, it will use its own tools to reach the source. The unit can now be launched.\n\nThe manned drilling unit reported that it has reached the location of the source. The location itself is already really strange.\n\nAfter reaching a proximity of about 300 meters to the location of the source, the crust material suddenly ended and they reached a hollow space inside the crust. Inside this space a construct that appears to be the source, is located. It is shaped in the form of an octahedron, with a diameter of exactly 2.5 kilometers at it's biggest extent.\n\nThe entire space around the object appears to be wobbling for unknown reasons, as if the object is projecting some sort of force field. This would also explain why there is such a big empty space around the source in the first place.\n\nBased on surface scans, the surface is composed of a material of unknown composition. Thermal scans reveal an astonishing property of the object. Its thermal temperature is at almost absolute zero, in the orders of zeptokelvin, colder than black holes. At such a low temperature, the state of an object can almost be seen as frozen in time. How the construct can reach this temperature and for what reason is unknown. The same can be said for the force field it appears to generate.\n\nScanners cannot penetrate the surface and detect no signs of emitting radiation, only average field excitations, and weak fluctuations of the $ehof_ep$.

And it did.\n\nOn one of the surfaces of the object, an entrance manifested. The crew entered and found something inside that can only be described as a mechanism of incredible complexity.\n\nThey studied it for a long time, just to find out that this mechanism was an additional blockade for the real entrance, some kind of identification checkpoint. They needed advanced computational assistance to solve the mechanism, but were successful nonetheless and were granted access. Inside, they found a hyper-complex technological system.\n\nAfter an intense study of the system, they were able to determine the initial function of the structure. It is not the source of the $ehof_ep$, but serves as an amplifier and repeater for it. The sequence appears to get transmitted via gravielectromagnetic waves to the edge of the solar system, where it, through an unknown mechanism, enters some form of faster-than-light travel.\n\nIt might be possible that the alien object, which is located at the edge of this solar system, the $ehof_gateway_disabled$, might have something to do with it.\n\nA distinct code sequence fragment of the $ehof_ep$, that appears to be compatible with the original code sequence that was discovered long ago, has been extracted from the amplifier object by the crew. Besides this, they've also made an astonishing discovery in regards to the composition of the amplifier object.\n\nTests on the inner composition of the object revealed that it is made of an unique, self-replicating and self-regenerating substance, similar to Living Metal. The crew was not able to determine what the substance is composed of, due to the lack of the necessary equipment, but it may possess a large scientific potential. For that reason, the crew took a sample of the substance for further analysis\n\nThe crew is preparing themselves for the journey back to the surface."

The crew had to experiment with intensity of the transmission in order to find the right one, which opened the object.\n\nThe entrance mechanism of the object was similar, but still distinct enough to prove a challenge for the crew. It is unknown if the intensity necessary to open the amplifier objects and the complexity of the entrance mechanism is different for every amplifier object, or if the objects communicate with each other somehow and change their properties.\n\nRegardless, the crew was able to extract another code sequence fragment of the $ehof_epcs$ and by combining it with the first two fragments, were able to gain limited access to the database of the amplifier and translate the information. They learned more about the enigmatic pattern itself, the primordial stones and $ehof_sm$.\n\nThe $ehof_gateway_disabled$ objects at the edges of the wormhole-cohesive systems appear to be, in fact, responsible for the transportation of the $ehof_epcs$ sequence over interstellar distances. The incredibly high energy content of the gravielectromagnetic waves, the pattern is getting transported through, seems to be necessary to activate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$.\n\nDue to the all known $ehof_gateway_disableds$ appearing to be dormant, it can be assumed that a specific energy intensity or something similar is needed in order to activate them. If this hypothesis is true or needs to be verified. In regards to $ehof_sm$, the crew was able to find out that it receives its orders from something which can only be described as an advanced A.I. routine, which is somehow integrated and distributed over the entire substance.\n\nIt is equipped with a multitude of different orders, which are getting executed depending on the environment of the substance. This A.I. routine is able perceive and analyse the environment and its influence on the $ehof_sm$ through unknown means, and gives the composite nanite particles the fitting order to adapt to it. This entire process gets carried out in less than a femtosecond, which is why the substance is able to react and adapt so quickly to environmental effects and circumstances.\n\nIt still doesn't explain how the substance is able to behave so lifelike, quasi sentient and how the substance is able to adapt in every location of it at once. With new specialized tools developed by our scientists, the crew was able to manipulate the A.I. routine and slightly change an adaption order, which forced the $ehof_sm$ to rearrange its shape.\n\nThis discovery could lead to the development of manufacturing techniques for specialized $ehof_sm$ components, for different technological uses, like armor for military units. We are still only scratching the surface of the potential of $ehof_sm$, but are definitely a step further ahead. The crew is now ready to travel back to the surface."

Based on the knowledge already gathered inside the other amplifier and the information found in the new one, the crew was able to determine how to activate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$! Three things are necessary for the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ to react to the transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ and activate, to transport it throughout interstellar space.\n\nFirst, the gravielectromagnetic waves, which transport the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, need to possess a specific energy content. If the energy content differs even slightly, regardless if it is less or higher, the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ will not react to the transmission and neutralize the gravielectromagnetic wave. Second, the kind of wave, which transports the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, needs to be gravielectromagnetic.\n\nThe reason for this appears to be that the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ won't get activated by other forms of radiation, with the same energy content necessary to activate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$. Third, the enigmatic pattern code sequence needs to be tuned perfectly to activate the $ehof_gateway_disabled$.\n\nThis serves as a way to ensure that the $ehof_gateway_disabled$ is only getting activated when truly needed and not accidentally. The crew was also able to gain additional knowledge about $ehof_sm$ from the amplifier.\n\nWith the new information the crew as able to extract from the amplifier database, they were able to further manipulate the orders of the A.I. routine to the point, that it might be possible to use $ehof_sm$, not only for self-regenerative structures composed of $ehof_sm$, but even to use it to regenerate other, non-$ehof_sm$ structures.

We now know that the nanite particles, the substance is composed of, are connected through an astonishingly advanced and complex network, with each nanite serving as neurons, eyes and hands, effectively making it a hive mind.\n\nEach nanite perceives the environmental information and instantly distributes it over the whole substance for the inherent A.I. routine to process it with the help of each nanite as processors. They then all get the orders from the routine at once, explaining the extremely fast adaptation mechanism of $ehof_sm$. The hive mind of the $ehof_sm$ is so advanced, that its computational capacity dwarfs even our largest quantum-computer networks and gives rise to the hypothesis, that it might not only be sentient, but even self-aware.\n\nNonetheless, with this new knowledge about $ehof_sm$, we might be able to use the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind's extreme computational capacity, to create systems which are controlled by the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind. Weapons, ships and structures being controlled by the hyper-complex $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind, would be able to react and adapt much faster than anything else we have and probably will ever have.\n\nWith all this newly acquired knowledge in mind, the crew of the drilling unit is ready to head back to the surface of the planet."

This manifestation of the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, serves as a master code, which can be used to open a connection to the origin of the $ehof_epcs$ itself! Based on the information extracted from the databases of the amplifiers, in general, only the origin itself appears to be capable of creating a connection between itself and other $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$.\n\nHowever, multiple amplifier objects, which work in unison, are also able to do it. At least six of them are needed for this, because only then can they create the entire master-code sequence. Where the origin is exactly located is still unknown, but an $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ will be able to connect to it, once we've got the whole sequence.\n\nOther than that, the crew was able to gather additional knowledge about $ehof_sm$ from the amplifier database. Besides learning more about the Hive Mind of the $ehof_sm$, they were able to learn more about how $ehof_sm$ and the ancient constructs that are composed of it, are getting powered by. Since the beginning of the discovery that the amplifiers and the $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ are composed of $ehof_sm$, we were not able to determine where the energy which powers them and allows them to be basically indestructible, for seemingly indefinite amount of time, comes from.\n\nThere were no signs of generators or power cores of any sorts. Now we know that the constructs make use of an ethereal energy, which apparently gets transmitted to the constructs from an undetectable source. It is entirely unknown if the energy even comes from the outside or if the constructs harness local vacuum energy or shroud energy to power themselves, but based on the immense energy content each of these constructs possess, it is unlikely that they make use of local vacuum energy, as it would not be sufficient enough to generate said energy content.\n\nIf so, there must still be an additional source of energy. In the case of it being shroud energy, it would at least explain the bizarre properties of the energy which drives the constructs. Nonetheless, learning about what kind of energy it is and where it comes from, may unlock the last secrets of the potential of $ehof_sm$ and the ancient constructs."

What we already know is the following. The amplifiers are capable of creating quasi-negative mass for an unknown purpose and are using the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$ to communicate with each other. The signal through which they communicate, the $ehof_epcs$ code sequence, is transmitted via gravielectromagnetic waves until it reaches an $ehof_gateway_disabled$, which then either reacts to it or doesn't react to it.\n\nThis depends on the frequency and amplitude of the $ehof_epcs$ and the intensity of the energy stored inside the gravielectromagnetic wave, which carries the $ehof_epcs$. If the $ehof_gateway_disabled$ does react, it transforms into an $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ and transmits the $ehof_epcs$ to the desired $ehof_cohesive$ system. The fundamental purpose for all this is still a mystery, but the investigation of the origin will hopefully reveal it to us.\n\nThanks to the master-code sequence, we will now be able to create a connection between an $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ and the origin of the enigmatic pattern.\n\nOther than that, with the knowledge gathered inside the amplifiers and the study of the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$, we are now able to research the technology to manufacture $ehof_sm$ and create our own $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$!"

The structure is definitely not of natural origin and appears to be getting defended by a vessel we have not encountered before, the Stellar Eradicator.\n\nWe should proceed with caution, as it looks to be hostile and heavily armed!

There's no indication as to where it went or if it might return.\n\nRegardless, we can now resume our mission, the reason we came here to begin with. The spherical object which is probably the origin of the enigmatic pattern.\n\nVisual and thermal scans of the surface show that it's perpetually in motion and changing between many different states of matter. It is neither solid nor liquid nor gaseous nor a plasma. It is all of them at once! Even ultra high or ultra low energy states of matter appear to exist within the surface's composition, like Bose-Einstein-Condensates, degenerate matter and even photonic matter.\n\nThe surface is also glowing on its own from time to time, at different locations, probably because of the decay of photonic matter and the constant phase transitions. Based on our knowledge about $ehof_sm$ and the fact that all the other primordial structures are made of it, it is likely that the surface is made out of the same material. Attempts to verify this hypothesis unfortunately prove futile, as the composition of the surface is impossible to determine with scanners, due to the constant and extremely rapid phase transitions. What's noteworthy is that it appears to possess specific colour schemes, that are the same almost all over construct. A gold-silver and orange. How all of this works is absolutely unknown.\n\nTwo circular shaped areas, which can only be defined as the 'poles' of this sphere, because perfect spheres don't have poles, are distinct from the main surface structure. They have a diameter of approximately 2 million kilometers and appear to be made out of a solid, crystalline material with a bronze-like colour. Unlike the rest of the surface, the poles are static and don't change in the slightest way. In the centers of these poles, some kind of large sigil, shaped in a similar form as the amplifiers and the sigils on the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, is located. It may be some sort of representative symbol of the creators of this construct, the amplifiers and the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$.\n\nJust like with the amplifier objects, the surface cannot be penetrated with scanners, but unlike them its temperature is not definable, due to the perpetually changing phases of the surface.\n\nAn entrance is not identifiable, if there is any, but it may be similar to the amplifier objects, whose entrances only 'manifest' under specific conditions.\n\nAn intense study of the structure will be necessary to determine its function and to find a way into it, which will probably be necessary to determine the function in the first place.

Their temperatures probably range in the orders of extremely low and extremely high temperatures.\n\nEvery form of equipment that would be used to even only touch the surface, would probably be destroyed in an instant. Instead, our researchers want to go with the approach of using the $ehof_epcs$. It was the key to get access to the amplifiers and the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, so it may be the key for $ehof_the_sphere$ as well. However, they will not just use any enigmatic pattern code sequence, but the master-code sequence. It is likely that, if the $ehof_the_sphere$ even reacts to the $ehof_epcs$ at all, it will be to the master-code sequence.\n\nDue to the immense size of $ehof_the_sphere$, a single transmitter will probably not be enough for it, in case that it might truly react to the $ehof_ep$. However, only one facility will be constructed to begin with. It will be a directional transmitter for the $ehof_epcs$ and emit the $ehof_ep$ onto the surface via gravielectromagnetic waves.\n\nConstruction of the facility can begin now."

After that, the researchers used gravielectromagnetic waves instead, as it was also necessary to use them for the $ehof_gateway_disableds$. This time, $ehof_the_sphere_named$ reacted, even if only for a short amount of time.

They aligned circularly from the center to the outside, forming a circle filled with evenly ordered notches.\n\nBased on the fact that 1 facility had 1 notch and 5 facilities have 216 notches, it can be determined that the number of notches increases with the power of three. The size of the notches themselves did not change.\n\nWith this rate of increase, it will take 126 facilities in total until the amount of notches and their alignment would cover the whole pole. Building an additional 110 of these expensive facilities would be an economical nightmare and our scientists are convinced that increasing the number until the whole pole is covered, would not lead to the manifestation of an entrance. They believe that the amount of signals emitted from the facilities alone is not enough, similar to how the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ do not react simply to the $ehof_epcs$, but only under specific conditions. Besides the quantity, the intensity, frequency and amplitude of the transmission is also important. The quantity and the quality of the transmission needs to be correct, to trigger the manifestation of an entrance.\n\nThe facilities will now begin to emit the $ehof_epcs$ master-code sequence with various intensities and configuration onto $ehof_the_sphere$, to verify this hypothesis."

With the right intensity and configuration, the notches merged into one large hole, with a diameter of 240 kilometers, and $ehof_the_sphere$ finally opened.\n\nOur scientists were even able to find out, that by applying the right intensity with a different number of facilities, increases or decreases the size of the entrance. This mechanism probably allows a multitude of different sizes for the entrance of $ehof_the_sphere$, maybe for transporting larger or smaller cargos into $ehof_the_sphere$.

It is composed of an array of hyper-advanced nano-machines, which are able to replicate themselves and together, can mimic many different forms of matter, and physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe way the substance behaves, makes it almost appear that the substance is not only alive, but even sentient. It is able to react to numerous different environmental conditions, with all its reactions being dedicated to adapting to the condition and ensuring the integrity of itself. Different forms of reactions have been observed.\n\nReplication, rearrangement and reshaping, in order to make the substance immune against any kind of damaging physical or chemical effect. Extreme heat, cold and corrosiveness, intense electromagnetic fields, different forms of radiation, mechanical pressure, lasers, even gravity. There seems to be no upper limit to the efficiency of its adaptive abilities, at least none we are able to determine.\n\nOther than its ability to transform and multiply to preserve itself, the structure is also capable of 'growing'. Its replicative abilities come in two different forms. The first form of replication appears when the substance needs to adapt to damaging environmental effects, at which it appears to be able to replicate itself out of nothing, perhaps by absorbing the energy or matter of the damaging effects itself, or by using an undetectable energy source.\n\nIn this case, the substance doesn't or only insignificantly increases its volume. The second form of replication appears, when the substance has adapted to any damaging effects and is in contact or close proximity to available matter or energy. It absorbs these to increase its volume, to 'grow', and can apparently absorb almost any known form of matter and energy.\n\nOnly gravitational energy, Dark Matter and Quasi-Negative Mass could not be absorbed. What the purpose of this 'growth' is, is unknown, but based on the reports about the amplifier, it didn't happen inside the amplifier itself, even though our crew and their tools were in direct contact to the substance. It appears that the substance is capable of being 'aware' about its environment and depending on the circumstances, react differently.\n\nOur scientists decided to name the substance '$ehof_sm$', as an analogy to Living Metal, due to its similarities. Even though we still know almost nothing about the substance or rather how it works, our scientific community is convinced that it possesses an unimaginable technological potential and they want to intensify our research on the substance and also the amplifiers.

Additionally, a project to investigate an Primordial Stones has been requested, as our scientists believe that they may have been constructed by the same entities that built the amplifiers, and could thus also be composed of $ehof_sm$."
