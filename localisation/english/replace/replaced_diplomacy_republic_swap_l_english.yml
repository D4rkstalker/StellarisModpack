CUSTODIAN_TO_COMMUNITY_MEMBER_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "The endless bickering in the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] has to stop if we, as a galaxy, are to accomplish anything of note."
CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Were it possible, we would sign legislation to outlaw the [From.GetName] forever. Sadly, that remains outside the scope of our legislative powers... for now."

CUSTODIAN_TO_COMMUNITY_MEMBER_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Perhaps you should rethink your membership in the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium], [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. As a nation of malcontents, you are a bad influence on the other members."

CUSTODIAN_TO_OUTSIDER_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "If only you would join the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]... the [From.GetName] would be such a positive example to the other members."
CUSTODIAN_TO_OUTSIDER_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] will not be complete until the [From.GetName] has joined it."

CUSTODIAN_TO_COMMUNITY_MEMBER_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We will do everything in our power to ensure that the [From.GetName] has a voice in the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]."
CUSTODIAN_TO_COMMUNITY_MEMBER_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "If every member of the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] were as friendly and helpful as the [From.GetName], there would be no need for a [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]."
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "[global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]. How goes your work to unite the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]? It can't be an easy task."
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "This is unexpected. Surely there are more pressing matters for the [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperor] to attend to?"
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We remain unconvinced that the [global_event_country.GetCustodianship] is truly necessary, but perhaps you will prove us wrong."
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Enjoy your lofty position while you can, [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]. It won't last."
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We are still trying to piece together how exactly you managed to con the Senate into granting you those [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort] powers."
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Since you assumed the [global_event_country.GetCustodianship], a heavy darkness has been looming over the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]. We fear it is slowly being subverted into something unrecognizable."
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "This is an unexpected honor, [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]. What can we do for you?"
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "How can we best be of service to the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium], [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]?"
MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] is lucky to have you, [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "So the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] has a "leader" now. Interesting."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The appointment of a [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort] does not make membership in the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] more appealing to us, but we shall see."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "So the other members of the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] are the vassals of the [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort] then? No? Apologies, but we are still struggling to understand the exact nature of this arrangement."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] has always been a rotten institution, and that was BEFORE the idiots in its Senate made you [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The members of the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] are bigger fools than we thought, if they offered the [global_event_country.GetCustodianship] to the [From.GetName]."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can't run the [From.GetName], and now you are expected to guide the entire [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]? Ha!"
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It looks like the Galactic Senate did something right for once when you were made [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s of the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium]! Perhaps we should consider membership."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] can only improve with you as its [global_event_country.GetCustodiansOrEmperors], [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "[global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperor], is it? We are happy to see you are moving up in the world, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"

custodian_request_friendly_1:0 "Truly, the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] would have collapsed long ago if not for the efforts of the $COUNTRY$. You make us proud to be [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s."
custodian_request_neutral:0 "As [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s, we consider this resolution to be in the galaxy's best interest."
custodian_request_neutral_0:0 "The [global_event_country.GetCustodianship] is a great responsibility to bear, but if we can pass these reforms it will have been worth it."
custodian_request_neutral_1:0 "We intend to use this [global_event_country.GetCustodianship] to reform the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] for the better."
custodian_request_hostile:0 "If not for troublesome members such as the $COUNTRY$, there would be no need for a [global_event_country.GetCustodianship]. Now do the right thing for once and support this resolution."
custodian_request_hostile_0:0 "As [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s, we are fighting to save the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] from scum like you. We will do everything in our power to limit your corrupting influence."
custodian_request_hostile_1:0 "Do you really want to remain on unfriendly terms with the [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperor]? Consider carefully if it is in your best interest to oppose this resolution..."
custodian_warning_friendly:0 "We urge you to reconsider. As [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s, there is much we can do for you."
custodian_warning_friendly_0:0 "I can guarantee that we have the best interests of the $COUNTRY$ in mind! Please reconsider."
custodian_warning_friendly_1:0 "There must be some mistake, friends. We are counting on your support!"
custodian_warning_neutral:0 "Your opposition is threatening to undermine the power of the Galactic [global_event_country.GetCustodianship]."
custodian_warning_neutral_0:0 "This resolution is critical to the future of the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]. As [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s, we don't say that lightly!"
custodian_warning_neutral_1:0 "We can't reform the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] without at least some help. Do you truly want this noble institution to descend into anarchy and corruption?"
custodian_warning_hostile:0 "You are fools to oppose the [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperor]."
custodian_warning_hostile_1:0 "You would do well to remember that as [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s, we have a great deal of influence... which could be leveraged against you."
custodian_warning_hostile_2:0 "Of course you oppose this! After all, if we were to reform the [global_event_country.GetCommunityOrImperium] and eliminate its corruption, where would vermin like you go?"
custodian_consequence_friendly:0 "We were counting on your support. How are we to get anything done as [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s when not even our supposed friends back our resolutions?"
custodian_consequence_neutral:0 "The [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] can be so much more than it is today. Can't you see that?"
custodian_consequence_hostile:0 "Stubborn fools. We WILL reform the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium], with or without the $COUNTRY$."
custodian_appreciation_friendly:0 "We knew we could count on the support of the $COUNTRY$. With your help, the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] will be reformed into something far greater than it is today."
custodian_appreciation_neutral:0 "Thank you for supporting our difficult work as [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperorShort]s. There are many resolutions to be passed."
custodian_appreciation_hostile:0 "It is good that you were able to put our differences aside and support the important work we are doing as [global_event_country.GetCustodianOrEmperor]."
