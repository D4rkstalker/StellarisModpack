 tech_basic_plastics: "Intelligent Plastics"
 tech_basic_plastics_desc: "We can make plastics stronger, smarter and possibly less dull, and develop alternative processes for producing goods without consuming so many minerals."
 tech_advanced_plastics: "Advanced Plastics"
 tech_advanced_plastics_desc: "We can make plastics stronger, smarter and possibly even less dull."
 
 tech_megacities: "Mega-Cities"
 tech_megacities_desc: "Having multiple large urban centers spread across a planet results in inefficiency in productivity, employment, law enforcement and other service provision. Instead, cities could be merged into much more efficient mega-cities."
 tech_heavy_industrialisation: "Centralised Industrialisation"
 tech_heavy_industrialisation_desc: "Lengthy and costly mineral supply chains from mining facilities to the industries that process them can be reduced by simply locating the industries alongside the mines that feed them."
