 ss_sacred.2.desc:0 "It begun as deviations... random static in the link with the outer parts of the mind.\n\nBut now it can be felt, whispers shiver up nerves endings, a slight tingle on the end of our appendages.\n\nSomething not too unlike ourself is whispering on dark currents of space and is coming towards us.\n\nAnd it will be here soon."
 ss_sacred.2.a:0 "Our unity will protect us"
 ss_sacred.2.b:0 "More Prey."
 
 ss_sacred_landing_evt_title:0 "Cosmic Whispers"

 pf_homeworld_category_desc:0 "Sitting in a high orbit above this planet is an automated knowledge repository.\n\nAdditionally, short range scans reveal limited biological activity on this barren rock which was first thought to not support life.\n\nFurther investigation warranted."
 
 ss_sacred.11.title:0 "Unidentified Arrival"
 ss_sacred.11.desc_01:0 "Our sensors have detected an unidentified ship that has arrived in the [event_target:ss_sacred_wormhole_system.GetName] system. Of particular interest is the construction of this vessel; it appears to be comprised mostly of organic tissues and lacks a discernable hyperdrive.\n\nWhat is perhaps most interesting is that it's trajectory places it's origin outside of our galaxy, probably the Utlana dwarf galaxy.\n\nSo far no signals have been detected from the vessel and it has not responded to universal greeting protocols. We should monitor it's actions."
 ss_sacred.11.desc_02:0 "The mind has sensed that the whispering entity has arrived. It is now in the [event_target:ss_sacred_wormhole_system.GetName] system and our long-range scanners confirm that this entity is extra-galactic in origin.\n\nIt is making no attempts to contact us and it's intent remains unknown. We should approach it with caution."
 ss_sacred.11.a:0 "Curious."
 ss_sacred.11.b:0 "So it had arrived."
 
 ss_sacred.13.title:0 "Visitor Destroyed"
 ss_sacred.13.desc_01:0 "Long range scanners have confirmed that the extra-galactic vessel has been destroyed by the [event_target:ss_pf_scout_killer.GetName] in the [event_target:ss_sacred_wormhole_system.GetName] system.\n\nWhatever it's intent or purposes will now never be known."
 ss_sacred.13.desc_02:0 "The cosmic whispers echoing throughout the galaxy have ceased. It appears the [event_target:ss_pf_scout_killer.GetName] have destroyed the galactic visitor in the [event_target:ss_sacred_wormhole_system.GetName] system. We sensed no pain; only that it ceased to live.\n\nWhatever it came here to do; whatever it is that made it, we will never know."
 ss_sacred.13.a:0 "Well, that's that."
 ss_sacred.13.b:0 "So it has departed."
 
 ss_sacred.14.title:0 "Wreckage"
 ss_sacred.14.desc_01:0 "Our forces have confirmed that the mysterious organic entity has been destroyed. It now displays zero activity.\n\nWhatever it's nefarious purpose was, we now live in peace knowing that it is gone.\n\nOur scientists are now scanning the unique biology of the wreckage to advanced our research."
 ss_sacred.14.desc_02:0 "We have successfully destroyed the biological eneity that is the galactic visitor.\n\nOur drones are now analysis the remains to advance our research programs.\n\nWhatever threat it posed, is now nullified."
 ss_sacred.14.a:0 "Well, that's that."
 ss_sacred.14.b:0 "The whispering stops."
 
 ss_sacred.22.title:0 "New Wormhole"
 ss_sacred.22.desc_01:0 "After a couple months of the unidentified vessel in the [event_target:ss_sacred_wormhole_system.GetName] system seemingly exploring the system, it has activated an unknown sort of device and produced a stable wormhole.\n\nWhere it leads is unknown, but it likely a destination outside of tthis galaxy. The vessel was last seen travelling through the wormhole to the other side.\n\nThere has been no signs of any other activity."
 ss_sacred.22.desc_02:0 "The whispering entity in the [event_target:ss_sacred_wormhole_system.GetName] system has realised it's purpose. It has produced a stable, traversable wormhole and has travelled through to the other side. It appears to lead to a destination outside of this galaxy.\n\nWhat lies on the other side?"
 ss_sacred.22.a:0 "Where does it lead?"
 ss_sacred.22.b:0 "It invites us."
 
 ss_pf_repository:0 "Ancient Repository"
 ss_pf_repository_desc:0 "This ancient facility stores vast quantities of data, research and historical accounts of a lost civilisation."
 
 ss_sacred.23.title:0 "Ancient Homeworld"
 ss_sacred.23.desc:0 "Further investigation of the planet reveals that there is indeed a living civilisation of it's surface. It appears to match the description of a hive mind, with interconnected drones and structures fulfilling specialised tasks.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that it's current state is a pale reflection of what it once was. The surface is littered with practically fossilized nerve clusters, nodes and countless drones. It is estimated that there now exists only a couple thousand remaining drones from a planet which would have supported hundreds of billions of drones.\n\nAdditionally, these drones go about tasks lethargically and don't respond to stimuli, or even acknowledge our presence. It is unknown what lead to this severe decline in the health of this hive mind. Nonetheless, they have left a repository in orbit with vast quantities of information, an orbital research station will reveal the answer in time."
 ss_sacred.23.a:0 "What happened here?"
 ss_sacred.23.b:0 "Not worth the effort to hunt."
 
 ss_sacred.25.title:0 "Ancient Knowledge"
 ss_sacred.25.desc_01:0 "With difficulty, we have finally gained complete access to the orbital repostiory in orbit of [event_target:ss_pf_home_world.GetName]. It is a vast, hybrid organo-mechanic structure that stores information akin to a nervous sytem. Upon acheiving access to it's databanks, it immediately produced information, seeming intended just fo us.\n\nAfter a challenging and extended period of interpretting the information delivered to us, it appears to be a medicinal technology. It is made just for us, for our specific biology, like the repository knew who and what we are and offered it straight to us.\n\nThis advanced medicine can be used to cure a wide variety of common diseases and even extend life. We will have no issues manufacturing and administering this medicine immediately. It is obvious the repository itself is intelligent, but not why it delivered this technology to us."
 ss_sacred.25.desc_02:0 "With difficulty, we have finally gained complete access to the orbital repostiory in orbit of [event_target:ss_pf_home_world.GetName]. It is a vast, hybrid organo-mechanic structure that stores information akin to an organic creature.\n\nAfter a challenging and extended period of simply interfacing with and interpretting the information kept within it, one of the first boons of access to its vast databanks is an organic technology. It appears to be a medicinal technology for biological life-forms, it will not be very useful to us."
 ss_sacred.25.a:0 "Incredible, distribute the medicine immediately."
 ss_sacred.25.b:0 "It is too risky, study the medicine instead."

 ss_sacred.26.title:0 "Ancient Knowledge"
 ss_sacred.26.desc:0 "We have made another breakthrough in deciphering the data of the respository in orbit of [event_target:ss_pf_home_world.GetName]. After progress has slowed down, another intact collection of technological designs have been deciphered. These designs describe efficient means of distribution and conservation energy in star-ships, but are perfectly suited to the current design of our vessels. Obviously, this technology was altered to be suited just for our purposes. These novel design concepts can be immediately implemented to reduce the upkeep of our space-borne vessels."
 ss_sacred.26.a:0 "Incredible, implement those designs immediately."
 ss_sacred.26.b:0 "It is too risky, study the designs instead."

 ss_sacred.27.title:0 "Ancient Knowledge"
 ss_sacred.27.desc:0 "Interfacing with the repository has been difficult, yet made easier by the fact that it operates much like our mind.\n\nIt is indeed made by and in the image of a mind not too unlike our own, with intelligence and awareness alike.\n\nIt has sensed our attempts to interface with it and has offered us a gift of knowledge; in-depth insights into the manipulation of gene-sequences and biological life. This information is incredibly insightful and will serve well in strengthening the hive."
 ss_sacred.27.a:0 "Incredible."

 ss_sacred.28.title:0 "Ancient Knowledge"
 ss_sacred.28.desc:0 "Further communication with the repository has been difficult, as if it is deliberately holding the knowledge we seek just out of reach. We have not been able to learn anything of the decayed hive on the surface of this world.\n\nBut suddenly, the repository has granted us access to another complete and useful set of knowledge, tailored and prepared just for us.\n\nThis knowledge details star-ship designs that maximise energy efficiency. These designs can be rapidly implemented to see immediate benefits in upkeep costs of star-ships."

 ss_sacred.30.title:0 "Failing Power"
 ss_sacred.30.desc:0 "The repository has suddenly closed off access to it's databanks and is in the process of powering down it's systems. Just before doing so, it delivered an information packet through our data links.\n\nThe repository adresses itself as the custodian of the dying civilisation below and is requesting that we supply it with food and energy so that is can power itself and restore damaged and decayed systems. It states that this is required to access its databanks again."
 ss_sacred.30.a:0 "So be it, provide what it demands."
 ss_sacred.30.a.tooltip:0 "A supply and food and energy will be delivered the planet's surface to re-invigorate the lethargic and decayed hive mind."
 ss_sacred.30.b:0 "We will not listen to it's demands."
 ss_sacred.30.b.tooltip:0 "We know nothing of the nature of this hive mind. It is simply too risky to revive something of this nature."
 
 ss_sacred.31.title:0 "Request"
 ss_sacred.31.desc:0 "The repository has established a remote connection with a nearby automated communications platform and is once again requesting that we deliver a shipment of food and energy to it.\n\nIt now states that if we don't listen to it's demands, it's databanks will be shut off forever as it suffers irreversible damage. It sounds as it is starving and dying.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 ss_sacred.31.a:0 "Fine, provide it with what it requests."
 ss_sacred.31.b:0 "Again, we will not grants it's requests."
 
 ss_sacred.32.title:0 "Detonation"
 ss_sacred.32.desc:0 "The repository's central fusion reactor has overloaded as it lost control of regulator that controls energy distribution. Subsequently, it has been completely destroyed.\n\nAppearing to quite literally living up it's warning, all that remains is twisted metal and biological debris. Whatever secrets it once contained are now lost forever."

 SS_PF_COUNTRY_DESC:0 "This hive mind once had mastery over itself and it's environment such that it could engineer it to perfection.\n\nCountless ages of decay have weighed heavily on it and it's health, but it is rapidly recovering."
 
 ss_sacred.50.title:0 "Sudden Regrowth"
 ss_sacred.50.desc:0 "After a delivery of food and energy to the repository, it promptly jettisoned a majority of the donated material towards the planet below, towards the dying hive mind. What transpired is not completely understood since the change was so rapid, but the few remaining drones below quickly reacted and assimilated the food and energy.\n\nBefore our very eyes, drone populations are exploding and new and old nerve clusters are springing to life. The rate of change is incredible and in but a few weeks it seems the planet will have significantly recovered."
 ss_sacred.50.a:0 "What will come of this?"
 
 ss_sacred.52.desc:0 "You are the [root.GetName] and we... are... the §YPrime Flesh§!."
 ss_sacred.52.a:0 "Where is this transmission coming form?"
 
 ss_sacred.53.desc_01:0 "You speak? You respond? You are a disconnected collective yet... intelligent and united.\n\nOur long search is finally over, and you have saved us from extinction. We are in your debt. \n\nWe require time to recover, but as galactic brethren, this debt will be repaid. In the meantime, we will permit continued remote access to the archive."
 ss_sacred.53.desc_02:0 "You speak? You respond? We.. sense you. You are like us.\n\nOur long search is finally over, and you have saved us from extinction.

 ss_sacred.53.a:0 "What are you?"
 ss_sacred.53.a.response:0 "We are the Prime Flesh, we are are a united collective bound by mastery of flesh acheived over millions of years.\n\nOur purpose is the preservation of intelligence, at all costs."
 ss_sacred.53.b:0 "What happened to your collective?"
 ss_sacred.53.b.response:0 "Observe our sector, it is barren and devoid of energy. It has not fully sustained us for millions of years and we have slowly withered away."
 ss_sacred.53.c:0 "Were you alone in this dwarf galaxy?"
