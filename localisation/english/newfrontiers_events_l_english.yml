 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.name:0 "Ancient Machine"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.desc:0 "A research team on [Root.GetName] discovered a strange structure deep in the ice of the planet. It appears to be some kind of ancient machine, probably built by a civilization that inhabited the planet several thousand years ago. Preliminary investigations by our scientists indicate that the machine is an unusual terraforming device. Apparently, the ancient builders of this machine wanted to use it to transform the planet from a cold and gloomy world into a blooming garden. This ancient device is designed to generate a powerful beam aimed into the depths of the near gas giant. Our scientists believe this was intended to force it to emit a variety of gasses that would then be captured by [Root.GetName]'s gravitational pull, ultimately causing a greenhouse effect. It is not clear whether the ancients ever used the machine or simply abandoned the project.\n\nThe machine has been perfectly preserved and our scientists have no doubt that they can start it if necessary. Alternatively, we can just take it apart and study the technology of the former architects in more detail."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.name:0 "Ancient Machine Disassembled"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.desc:0 "Our scientists completed the disassembly of the ancient terraforming machine on [Root.GetName].

We will learn valuable ancient knowledge when we study it properly."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.3.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Our physicists say that the beam initiated thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant! It looks like the machine really works, albeit in an unexpected way. The temperature on [Root.GetName] is rising steadily, and its glaciers are beginning to melt."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.4.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Our physicists say that the beam initiated thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant! It looks like the machine really works, albeit in an unexpected way. The climate on [Root.GetName] is improving beyond our wildest expectations."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.5.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Unfortunately the gas giant emitted far more gas than our projections indicated, blocking the starlight and plunging [Root.GetName] into a deep freeze. Few managed to escape as [Root.GetName] turned into a barren frozen world in a matter of days."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.6.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Our physicists say that the beam initiated thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant! Glaciers began to melt rapidly, but the shifting weight of the rising oceans destabilized [Root.GetName]'s tectonic plates. Magma unleashed from the planet's core and reacted with its oceans on an apocalyptic scale, literally tearing the planet's crust apart. This happened in just a few hours, and no one had time to escape."

According to a research team quickly sent to investigate, all of its population has inexplicably disappeared. The infrastructure of the settlement remains intact, but there is no sign of the missing colonists."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.a:0 "Very disturbing."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Another Long Night"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has again fallen into darkness following another dip in its star's intensity. Remembering the disappearances during the last period of darkness, residents have prepared themselves for the worst. A special communications bunker has been established to maintain constant contact with the central government, recording and relaying everything that happens on [Root.GetName]. If something is wrong, we will find out."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.a:0 "We will be vigilant!"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.13.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Colony Attacked!"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.13.desc:0 "Attention! We received an urgent message that a major settlement on [Root.GetName] was attacked by unknown creatures.

Apparently, the ancient builders of this machine wanted to use it to transform the planet from a cold and gloomy world into a blooming garden. The operating principle of the machine is interesting. This ancient device is designed to generate a powerful beam, causing disturbances in the depths of the gas giant around which [Root.GetName] orbits.

 newfrontiers_periodic_event.31.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: the ice age has come"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.31.desc:0 "The ice age on [Root.GetName] has finally arrived. The face of the planet has changed beyond recognition. Residents will have to adapt to new conditions of survival on this harsh world."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.33.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: global warming"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.33.desc:0 "Global warming on [Root.GetName] continues. Glaciers are thawing and the average temperature is becoming more moderate. Many species of animals and plants could not adapt to such drastic changes. The climate of the planet is getting softer."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.34.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: global warming has ended"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.34.desc:0 "Global warming on [Root.GetName] has finally come to an end. The face of the planet has changed beyond recognition. A new life begins to fill this once-frozen world. The planet is waking up."
 
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.36.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: meteor shower"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.36.desc:0 "The planet [Root.GetName] entered a stream of large meteorites caused by the activity of other active celestial bodies such as comets and planetesimals, which, in turn, were affected by the gravitational interaction of large celestial bodies. Now the planet is regularly bombarded by large meteorites that do not burn in the atmosphere. The planet will not soon come out of this dangerous area of space and the surface may be subject to damage for months."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.38.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Incessant Thunderstorms"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.38.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], a season of severe storms and thunderstorms has begun. Monstrous cyclones form in the atmosphere, which cover entire continents and create zones of active convection. In these zones, a huge number of short-period electric discharges are formed, which move on the planet with a wide front and destroy everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.40.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Terrible Hurricanes"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.40.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season for the formation of convergent cyclones and anticyclones has begun. This event is marked by the formation of cyclones and anticyclones in areas with low and high temperatures, which then begin to actively collide. This event generates violent storms and many atmospheric vortices in convergence zones. Many deadly tornadoes sweep across the surface of the planet."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.42.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Heavy Blizzards"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.42.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the global sandstorm season has begun. During this period, foci of sandstorms form on the planet, which can reach sizes of several thousand kilometers in diameter. In the areas covered by such a storm, few can survive in the open."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.44.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Heavy Sandstorms"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.44.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the global snowstorm season has begun. When the season of strong winds comes, they raise tons of snow into the atmosphere. A colossal cloud covers the entire planet, blocking out most sunluight. The temperature difference further enhances the activity of snow cyclones and the planet remains in cold captivity for a long time."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.46.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Prolonged Drought"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.46.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], a season of long drought has begun. A hot climate has always been the norm on this planet, but even the most hardy species are unable to survive during periods of intense solar activity. Almost all water bodies dry out, the air becomes suffocating, and the soil is covered with a hot crust."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.48.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Coriolis Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.48.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of the formation of strong Coriolis storms began. In this season of solar activity, a strong temperature difference occurs between the day and night side of the planet. As a result, a strong pressure drop occurs in the equatorial regions, which constantly shifts towards the terminator. A hurricane wind occurs in the drop zone, which is greatly enhanced by the rotation of the planet. Large expanses of flat plains on the continents offer no obstacles to the constant acceleration of the Coriolis storm. A hurricane wind passes through a wide front across the entire surface of the planet and can reach 700 km/h, sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.50.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Geomagnetic Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.50.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], a season of constant geomagnetic storms has begun. The has planet entered the zone of intense solar wind, which creates large disturbances in the geomagnetic field of the planet. The interaction of ionized particles occurs over almost the entire surface of the planet’s magnetosphere. This causes malfunctioning of all electromagnetic devices and inevitably leads to a drop in the production capacity of the planet."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.52.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Ion Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.52.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of ion storms has begun. The weakening of the planet’s magnetosphere leads to ionization of the upper atmosphere and provokes the emergence of monstrous and destructive storms. These storms create a background of electrical discharges that inflict huge damage in the affected area. The zones of ionic storms turn into lifeless wastelands."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.54.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Wild Hunt"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.54.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of activity of local predators has begun. During this period, animals become especially aggressive and unite in packs that attack our settlements."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.56.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Insatiable Swarm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.56.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of activity of arthropod colonies has begun. During this period, swarms of insect-like creatures swarm to the surface from their underground hives and attack settlements."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.58.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Abyssal Devourers"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.58.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of activity of aquatic predators has begun. During this period, many monsters appear from the depths of the oceans and terrorize marine settlements."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.60.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Sea Monsters"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.60.desc:0 "We recorded the appearance of many colossal creatures in the oceans of [Root.GetName]. These leviathans were probably hibernating on the seabed. Most likely our activity on the planet woke them up. Now the woken giants are sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.62.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Tremor Earth"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.62.desc:0 "We recorded the appearance of many colossal creatures from beneath the surface of [Root.GetName]. These leviathans were probably hibernating in underground tunnels. Most likely our activity on the planet woke them up. Now the woken giants are sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.64.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Huge Beasts"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.64.desc:0 "We recorded the appearance of many colossal creatures in the forests of [Root.GetName]. These leviathans were probably hibernating in remote regions and caves. Most likely our activity on the planet woke them up. Now the woken giants are sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.66.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Strong Volcanism"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.66.desc:0 "The planet [Root.GetName] has entered a period of intense volcanism. More and more extinct volcanoes are waking up, and toxic emissions into the atmosphere have become more frequent. Lava flows erupt to the surface, sweeping away everything in its path."
