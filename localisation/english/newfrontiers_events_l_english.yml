 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.9.desc:0 "If there truly is an object somewhere beneath the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], it lies far too deep to be detected by the sensors of the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has abandoned the search."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.11.desc:0 "Acting on orders from Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], the [Root.GetName] sent a probe into the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] to investigate the life signs that had been reported. The presence of a rich atmospheric ecosystem was discovered, but 3.4 seconds later the probe contaminated the atmosphere and triggered a chemical chain-reaction that spread rapidly across the entire brown dwarf. No signs of life can be detected now."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.17.desc:0 "If there were anomalous energy readings coming from [From.From.GetName], they appear to be gone now. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the [Root.GetName] has detected nothing of the sort."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.32.desc:0 "After recalculating the orbit of the comet that was supposedly on a collision course with [From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has arrived at the conclusion that it will simply be a near miss. The [Root.GetName] should be redeployed to deal with more pressing matters."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.900.desc:0 "Tragic news from [From.From.GetName]. The Science Officer in charge was killed by an electrical discharge while traveling inside the gas giant's upper atmosphere in a small shuttlecraft. The crew of the [Root.GetName] have aborted their mission."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.901.desc:0 "We are still trying to piece together the details, but for some reason it looks like the Science Officer ordered the [Root.GetName] into the upper atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] to investigate a sensor anomaly. Once there the stress to the vessel's hull eventually became too great, and it was lost with all hands."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.902.desc:0 "While conducting deep scans of [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a reactor failure and became trapped inside the gas giant's gravity well. The vessel's Science Officer successfully oversaw the evacuation of the entire crew, but the ship itself was pulled into the planet's dense atmosphere never to be seen again."
 newfrontiers_anomaly_failure.903.desc:0 "While approaching [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] stumbled upon two unknown vessels hiding in the gas giant's sensor shadow. They appear to be smugglers partaking in some kind of clandestine meeting. As soon as they spotted your ship, the smuggler ships disconnected from each other and powered up their weapons. They seem intent on not leaving any witnesses!"

 brown_dwarf.2.desc:0 "During the study of brown dwarf [from.GetName] ship [Root.GetName] found in the upper atmosphere of the giant planet structure. The huge structure resembles a lattice of many cells, which soars in the atmosphere. Apparently design is not less than a thousand years, she is corrupted and used to be much larger. Now part of the mechanisms are still working and not letting it fall and burn in the bowels of subsidy. It is not yet clear what this giant structure represents and for what purposes it was built. \n\nLeading scientist [Root.GetLeaderName] convinced that this structure must be studied."
 brown_dwarf.3.desc:0 "Construction soaring in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf [from.From.GetName] turned out to be a huge power plant that accumulates energy emitted by the planet. Lead scientist [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that its team was able not only to successfully investigate the object, but also to restore the health of the giant complex by running most of the mechanisms.\n\Batteries of the planetary energy grid are already accumulating energy. For its delivery and use, we only need a space station in orbit."

This event can already be seen in a few months. \n\nThe scientists would like not to miss this cataclysm to capture it, but it will not be easy to have time at the right time."
 brown_dwarf.5.desc:0 "We managed to capture the moment of collision of a brown dwarf [BrownDevourer.GetName] with comet! We recorded from several cameras and broadcast it live to all our worlds. Our scientists and their leader [Root.GetLeaderName] managed to get a large amount of data that will be very useful in future studies. But the most important thing is that the comet was very rich in valuable minerals. After the collision around the planet, an asteroid ring was formed, which will become a very attractive place for mining."
 brown_dwarf.6.name:0 "Abnormal Activity"
 brown_dwarf.6.desc:0 "The research vessel discovered in the depths of a brown dwarf [From.GetName] abnormal activity. Contrary to physical laws, this sub-star exhibits strange thermonuclear activity, which our sensors immediately caught.

It was probably built by a race that inhabited [Root.GetName] a few thousand years ago. It didn't take long for our scientists to determine the purpose of this device. We can say with confidence that the machine is an unusual terraforming device. Apparently the ancient builders of this machine, wanted to transform the planet from a cold and dark world into a blooming garden. Interesting is the principle of operation of the machine, this ancient device, with a powerful beam, was to cause disturbances in the bowels of the gas giant, around which the planet rotates [Root.GetName]. A gas giant, with the help of complex chemical processes, had to provide enough heat to melt the ice on the planet [Root.GetName]. It is not clear whether the ancients used their machine or abandoned this project.the device has been perfectly preserved for thousands of years and our scientists have no doubt that they can start the machine if necessary.
