onactiondiplo.11.desc:0 "Until now the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] has used an itinerant senate, passing from nation to nation with each new meeting. As the community grows in importance, however, so does the bureaucracy necessary to sustain it. Galactic leaders have agreed that this system is unsustainable.\n\nIn the coming years, the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] will decide on a permanent host for the Senate. While the host would be shouldered with the senate's upkeep, it would surely still be a net benefit were the galactic senate to fall within [Root.GetAdj] space, so we can choose to §Ypromote our capital§! for this purpose."
onactiondiplo.11.desc.phobe:0 "Until now the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] has used an itinerant senate, which regrettably meant that the [Root.GetName] would sometimes be responsible for hosting it. Recently, however, galactic leaders have agreed to find the senate a permanent host.\n\nIt will take several years for the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] to agree on a suitable candidate. We could, if we wished, choose to §Ypromote our capital§! for this purpose, but it is unlikely that the benefits of hosting the senate will outweigh the cost of housing so many filthy aliens."
