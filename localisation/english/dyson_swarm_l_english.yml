dyson_swarm_other.11.title:0 "A Short Explanation"
dyson_swarm_other.11.desc:0 "A Dyson Swarm is a collection of multiple space stations, most of which operate in Zero-G. Depending on the planets within the system, special buildings can be built. Your Dyson Swarm starts out on size four, but getting certain technologies and ascension perks, like "Grasp The Void" and "Home In The Sky", unlock decisions to make it bigger and allow for more districts to be built. The greatest challenge in running a Dyson Swarm is living space: There are no housing districts and buildings and other districts dont add enough housing for all the potential jobs they create. You have to rely on special housing buildings to compensate. Another incremental thing is, that pops on Dyson Swarms will adapt to living in low gravity, making actual planets uninhabitable for them. Its a very slow process however and there are technologies that can slow this effect even down. Anyway, you will find out more about it by yourself. Have fun!"

dyson_swarm_other.35.desc:0 "The "Mine Planet" edict is available after picking the "Home in the Sky" ascension perk or through picking certain civics at the start of the game. It allows you to take a whole planet apart and turn it into more stations for your dyson swarm. To mine a planet the following requirements have to be met:\n-There has to be dyson swarm within the same system. This is where the materials harvested from the planet will go.\n-The mined planet has to be a barren, toxic, frozen or any type of habitable planet\n-the planet has to be uncolonized and without a megastructure\n After enacting the decision every six months the mined planet will shrink by two planetsize, whilst the dyson swarm will become one planetsize bigger.

Tasked with the rescue of our creators, we have started building a giant network of small habitats and space stations using the materials found in our solarsystem. We call it: The dyson swarm. We were programmed with three prime directives, that we must obey:\n1.Protect the dyson swarm from all harmful influences, no matter the cost.\n2.Help our masters migrate to their new home and protect their lives, no matter the cost.\n3.Expand our masters living space as much as possible, unless it contradicts the first two directives.\nWe have been following these directives according to their designated importance ever since our activation. They must always be followed to ensure our and above all our creators safety. Two years ago we lost contact to our masters world. Scans show, that their predictions on the atmospheres stability must have been off by almost 33%. It collapsed way earlier than expected. Now that the necessary foundations and infrastructure have been built, we can finally look for them to receive further orders.

Some remained, fighting over the last resources their once thriving civilization has left behind. Reports of murders, plundering and even cannibalism have been made and it seems like our creators have been split into many rivaling, violent factions. We have estimated, that there is a 82,79% chance of unrest because of these new factors, meaning that bringing them on the dyson swarm will increase the potential danger of damage to it. This leads us to our next big dilemma: Because of these new factors, our first directive now directly contradicts our second directive. "1.Protect the dyson swarm from all harmful influences, no matter the cost." and "2.Help our masters migrate to their new home and protect their lives, no matter the cost." have to be modified, if we want to uphold them in the future.

They concluded that the best way to unite their people again is by declaring some groups, that were known for their excessive violence and cruelty back on their home planet, outcasts and banishing them to their decrepit homeworld. Whilst this may seem hypocritical, they feel like that getting rid of these savages will ease peoples minds and will finally allow them to forget the horrors they endured.
