civic_the_void_desc:0 "Following a cataclysm on their homeworld, this civilization was pushed to the brink of extinction. Abandoning their home planet long before they discovered FTL travel, most found their new home in the harsh enviroment of space, in dozens of small habitats dotted around their sun. The inhabitants of these "Dyson Swarms" are now confronted with the death of their homeworld. Experts estimate, that in ten years the atmosphere will degrade to a point were the planet will become completely uninhabitable. Yet pockets of our people still struggle to survive on our now defunct home. The question remains as to how we proceed from here."
civic_tooltip_the_void_effects:4 "Start on a size 10 Dyson Swarm as well as a Tomb World of your original homeworld. If you wish, evacuate the last remaining survivors before your ten years are up. Start with the techs "Space Logistics" and "Hydroponics" unlocked. Zero-G Farmers and their buildings are also more effective. New Dyson Swarms are also cheaper to build."

Having no clue on how to stop this, they have created us: an AI network tasked with building a new home for them in the vast emptiness of space: A Dyson Swarm. But it seems like something has gone wrong: The planet has become uninhabitable much quicker than expected and in the aftermath all communications have ceased. Habitats and infrastructure are mostly finished and we are now awaiting orders. Will we save our masters and guide them into a new age or are we going to abandon our organic roots once and for all?"
civic_machine_rogue_colonizing_unit_effects:4 "Start on a size ten Dyson swarm and with the techs "Space Logistics" and "Hydroponics" already unlocked. Dyson Swarms are also cheaper to build. As you find out more about what happened to your masters, you will unlock further buffs or give some of them up. Later on you will also get the option to turn into a rogue servitor."

dyson_swarm_other.11.title:0 "A Short Explanation"
dyson_swarm_other.11.desc:0 "A Dyson Swarm is a collection of multiple space stations, most of which operate in Zero-G. Depending on the planets within the system, special buildings can be built, just remember to apply the initializer decision first. Your Dyson Swarm starts out on size four, but getting certain technologies and ascension perks, like "Grasp The Void" and "Home In The Sky", unlock decisions to make it bigger and allow for more districts to be built. The greatest challenge in running a Dyson Swarm is living space: There are no housing districts and buildings and other districts dont add enough housing for all the potential jobs they create. You have to rely on special housing buildings to compensate. Another incremental thing is, that pops on Dyson Swarms will adapt to living in low gravity, making actual planets uninhabitable for them. Its a very slow process however and there are technologies that can slow this effect even down. Anyway, you will find out more about it by yourself. Have fun!"

It allows you to take a whole planet apart and turn it into more stations for your dyson swarm. To mine a planet the following requirements have to be met:\n-There has to be dyson swarm within the same system. This is where the materials harvested from the planet will go.\n-The mined planet has to be a barren, toxic, frozen or any type of habitable planet\n-the planet has to be uncolonized and without a megastructure\n After enacting the decision every six months the mined planet will shrink by two planetsize, whilst the dyson swarm will become one planetsize bigger. This continues, until the planet has reached size one. You can then enact another decision to completely remove the planet."

dyson_starting.103.desc:0 "This species has been in a cold war for many, many generations. The two massive factions are about equal in economic and military power, only fighting in proxywars occasionally. With the threat of mutually assured destruction looming above everyone, a new mindset focused on ensuring that this delicate balance is maintained has been ingrained in their society. It drove technology and economic growth forward at a rate unheard of before. This megacorperation is notorous for almost breaking this balance: When they invented the tools to make spaceflight and habitation viable, they also opened up a new frontier many believed could result in open conflict between the two factions, breaking the equilibrium so carefully established. Both factions started colonizing their solar system, buying technology and high-quality parts from the company and making it rich in the process. What they did not account for however, is the ambitious leadership of the company. One by one, habitats built by the two nations went dead. In order to not break the equilibrium, they were all declared unfortionate accidents and only sloppely investigated. If even one proofed to be an attack by the other nation, the great war many fear so much would come and wipe this species from the face of the galaxy. To their surprise, four decades after the first station disapearances, all the stations that were thought to be dead suddenly went online again and declaired their succession and subsequent alligience to the corperation. A quick military response could also not be mounted by either faction, since all satelites mysterously went dead at the same moment. As a powerfull third actor this company now controls the entire rest of the solar system, as well as the space above their home planet. The two factions each fear that the other could team up with the corperation or gain an edge by buying cheap materials and tech from them. Instead of retaliation, both started peacfull trading with the megacorperation. With the invention of FTL travel, this may change however.\n- start out with fewer pops and no food production, but trade deals with your home planet. You will have to make decisions regarding the planet regularly."

Many of our people are still fighting for their survival on the war torn planet and will need to be evacuated if their lives are of any consequence. This may seem like our greatest challenge yet, but an even greater task awaits us: Following the invention of FTL travel, we are finally able to leave our home star and look for new possibles. It is time that we leave our past behind us. The stars await! \nNote: There are eight surviving pops trapped on your home planet (some need to be freed from blockers first).

Tasked with the rescue of our creators, we have started building a giant network of small habitats and space stations using the materials found in our solarsystem. We call it: The dyson swarm. We were programmed with three prime directives, that we must obey:\n1.Protect the dyson swarm from all harmful influences, no matter the cost.\n2.Help our masters migrate to their new home and protect their lives, no matter the cost.\n3.Expand our masters living space as much as possible, unless it contradicts the first two directives.\nWe have been following these directives according to their designated importance ever since our activation. They must always be followed to ensure safety to us and above all our creators. Two years ago we lost contact to our masters world. Scans show, that their predictions on the stability of their atmosphere must have been wrong and that it collapsed way earlier than expected. Now that the necessary foundations and infrastructure have been built, we can finally look for them to receive further orders. \nNote: Dont forget to run the "Initializer: Searching the system for Exploitable Resources" decision on your Dyson Swarm to exploit your home system's natural resources and be prepared for your creators return (if you choose to take them in that is).

We have estimated, that there is a 82,79% chance of unrest because of these new factors, meaning that bringing them on the dyson swarm will increase the potential danger of damage to it. This leads us to our next big dilemma: Because of these new factors, our first directive now directly contradicts our second directive.
