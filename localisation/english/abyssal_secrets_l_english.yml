The entire effort was masterfully coordinated between all 22 assailants, each contributing to varying degrees. However there was no attempt to cover their tracks or to escape arrest, despite the stealthy excecution of the bombing.

Despite having taken little interest in galactic affairs previously, it is understood that they take the threat of the §RAbyssal Host§! particularly seriously, prompting a flurry of activity from the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§!. At first, it was just a few science vessels, deploying hidden and remotely operated sensor probes, but now reports have began to came in of [From.GetSpeciesName] war fleets mustering on their borders and arcane structures being erected in orbit and on the surface of their worlds.\n\nMost recently, the §H[From.GetName]§! have fully emerged from their self-imposed isolation to take a leading role in the defense of the whole galaxy and the handling of the emerging crisis. They have proclaimed themselves the leaders of a §HGalactic Defense League§! and extended an invite to all "lesser" species to put aside their feuds and join them in repelling this menace for the sake of the integrity of the galaxy."

Highly advanced scouting vessels visiting ancient worlds and inspecting old factories of war, refusing all hails and fleeing when attacked.\n\nIt is obvious that the [From.GetSpeciesName] are preparing, recovering the databanks of survey beacons and automated scouting posts left behind when they retreated to their present borders. Gathering information and resources for their return to the galactic stage.\n\nIn [From.GetSpeciesName] space, fleets are gathering, armies are being mustered and ancient factories roar to life. For the first time in an age, the §H[From.GetName]§! are looking outwards beyond their borders and towards the galaxy at large.\n\nIt appears that they are preparing to not only deal with a galactic crisis of any sort; but also bring the entire galaxy into line such that these existential threats will never arise again."

This combined with coherent high-energy emissions from §YThe Eye§!, a feature no other black hole exhibits, our scientists recommend we target and destroy as many Abyssal Host vessels as possible to gain insights into these strange phenomenon, while remote observations are performed. They estimate destroying §R400 ships§! will generate actionable insights; progress can be viewed in the situation log.\n\nWith these insights, we find a way to prevent the Abyssal Host from using these black holes as gateways."
