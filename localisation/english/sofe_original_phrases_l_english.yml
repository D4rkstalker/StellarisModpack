01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ANGRY_GREETING: "Oh well, guess we can't have nice things these days!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_1: "Vad'i, [from.GetName]. To what do I owe you the pleasure?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_2: "After aeons of pointless struggles, it is good to see the galaxy is finally getting back together. But for how long?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_3: "The Great Question. The answer to it, is as important as the question itself. Or should we say "Questions"?\n\nWe suspect that the answer will only lead to many more questions."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_4: "I am sorry, [from.GetName]. Our artisans have not yet fully compose the songs for your empire. But progress is quite smooth. Do you prefer us to make tales of your triumphs only? Or are not afraid to relive some of your flaws?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_5: "Cooking a proper dish can be quite difficult, sometimes. We have archived over 2,381,761,612 types of ingredients. Some of which are very lethal to mortals, so please avoid trying to smuggle any of them without our proper instructions."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_6: "Sometimes we gazed into the void...and it gazed back into us. Sometimes it frightens our fearless hearts.\n\nThere are still out there...the ghosts of the past. Will they ever reemerge?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_7: "The Light unites us all towards one purpose. What kind of philosophy does your empire employ to unite your people?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_8: "Do you wish to learn more of our languages? No? Don't worry, the fallen empires also did not bother to do that. After all, translators usually work, if we want them to."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_9: "We the [root.GetSpeciesName] are descendants of the stars themselves. Our origins date back billions of years ago. Some of us can still reflect upon those moments with perfect clarity.\n\nThose were...trying times."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_10: "We will need to study the societies of this cycle more before we can rebuild the Caretakers. Perhaps this time, they will not be so easily...broken.\n\nHonestly, we understand why they would not return to us. Their directives still held true, but their loyalties have been tampered.\n\nTime grinds even the mountain to dusts."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_ENIGMATIC_GREETING_11: "We do not know where will the Great Question leads to. But we know that it is a place beyond time, and time beyond counting.\n\nWe are all but small fishes against the tides of fate."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_GREETING_1: "All your bases are belong to us. You have no chance to survive, make your time.\n\nHa Ha Ha\n\nThat was a meme by the way. We picked that one up around 318,469 years ago from one of the weird machine empires. It is quite amusing to say it."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_GREETING_2: "How many times have you been calibrating your weapons this time? 50? that should have increased your damage potential by almost over 250%."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_CUSTODIAL_GREETING: "My Life for Arya!"
02_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_CUSTODIAL_GREETING: "Inexorable, the end times are."
03_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_CUSTODIAL_GREETING: "We are greetings you using the conditions that should not in theory be possible. Interesting, why has this galaxy been designed this way? Whose incompetence leads to this folly?"

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_PROPOSE_1: "You have been selected to participate in yet another war with us, [from.GetName]. Let us see whether both of us are still as good as our last conflict."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_PROPOSE_2: "Vad'i. The Hand has decided to test your resolve. Prepare for war, my friend!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_PROPOSE_3: "It is time, [from.GetName]. Are you ready to face the might of our empire? We shall see."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_ACCEPT_1: "Let us engage in glorious battle worthy of the ancestors then, my children!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_ACCEPT_2: "My life for Arya! We march boldy without fear!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_WAR_ACCEPT_3: "To war then! Brace yourselves. For we the Stellar'dere shall test your strengths."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_CONSIDER_1: "Be patient. The Hand will decide whether peace is preferable outcome for this war."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_CONSIDER_2: "Very well. We will determine whether this war has gone on long enough, then we will respond."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_PROPOSE_1: "The Hand has deemed that this war is reaching its conclusion. Perhaps a compromise is in order?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_PROPOSE_2: "Looks like this is it. Enough bloodshed, let us find another path."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_PROPOSE_WG1: "The Hand believes this game is over. I think it is time you consider...surrendering?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_PROPOSE_WG2: "It's over, [from.GetRulerName]! We have the high ground! Don't try it! Just surrender."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_ACCEPT_1: "So shall it be then, the war between our two empires is over. Hopefully this will be the last time, its getting old."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_ACCEPT_2: "The Hand has accepted the terms. The war will now end and we all can go back to doing more productive things.."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_REFUSE_1: "Mi'das. We are just getting started. Why so soon?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_PEACE_REFUSE_2: "No can do, sorry. We have to respect the rules and you know it. This cannot happen this early."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_OFFER_1: "The Hand wishes to make a trade with your empire. Please take it under advisement."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_OFFER_2: "Vad'i. Perhaps you may be willing to make some barter with us?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_OFFER_G1: "Vad'i. We have decided that some compensations are in order for the damages we have done."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_OFFER_G2: "We have not much need for these resources. But they may be useful to your empire, if you wish."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_CONSIDER_1: "Very well. We will take it under advisement."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_CONSIDER_2: "Please excuse us for a moment. We will notify our decisions soon."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_ACCEPT_1: "Very well. Let the exchange commences."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_ACCEPT_2: "This proposal is suitable for the both of us. Let us to it."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_ACCEPT_G1: "We are not sure why you see the need to do this...we don't have any uses for these resources. But if you wish to do so, it would be impolite for us to refuse such gifts."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_TRADE_ACCEPT_G2: "This is unnecessary for us. But we appreciate the gesture. Although you shouldn't do this often, especially if you are trying to bribe us.\n\nApologies, we are still adjusting to this kind of social interactions, it has been awhile. Forget what we said earlier, your gifts are well appreciated."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_PROPOSE_1: "Not totally sure why are we declaring you a rival. I guess it's one of those times where things just doesn't work the way they are supposed to. Do not take this too seriously."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_PROPOSE_2: "I think we just declared you a rival...uhh why is this happening again?\n\nApologies, we cannot dictate these kind of odd behaviors sometimes. I wonder what sorcery has transpired here."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_GET_1: "You are making us a...rival? Ok then..uhh..are you taking this seriously or just hoping to gain some extra influences to meet your empire's quota?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_GET_2: "Are we understanding this correctly? You are declaring us a rival?\n\nWe do not fully understand why you have to tell us this. Shouldn't this be something you keep a secret so that your "rival" would not be aware you are plotting against them?\n\nHmmm...or perhaps this is an intimidation strategy?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_1: "Ta'lak. Do we have to declare you a rival back? We haven't exactly been declared a rival before so this is quite new to us, honestly.\n\nBut your intents has been noted. We hope you are not biting more than you can chew however."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_2: "A rival then. Very well, if that's how it is.\n\nHopefully this is not going to turn into the Third Progenitor War or the Second Ascension War...We are meant to be better than this.\n\nPlease reconsider this rash behavior. It does not benifit both of us. "

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_END_PROPOSE_1: "Looks like we have managed to fix the odd behaviors now. The [root.GetName] will effectively stop considering you a rival. Let us hope no damages were done to our diplomacy"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_END_SELECT_1: "So now you are going to end your rivalry agaisnt us?\n\nHmm...perplexing and puzzling indeed.\n\nWe need to study this galaxy further. There must be some secret strategems behind your odd actions. We knew that many cycles ago, various empires used to employ various methods to ensure that neighbouring powers would declare wars on them. And the sole purpose of doing that is to get them to open borders so that their science ships could pass.\n\nAre you emplying similar tactics here?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_RIVAL_END_ACCEPT_1: "Dee'mk. Finally peace and quiet is restored. We shall now return to our meditations.\n\nAnd cooking, that is one of the primary reasons we have our physical forms. Afterall, eating without a form can be quite difficult."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_BORDER_OPEN_PROPOSE_1: "The Hand has deemed that the [from.GetName] is trustworthy enough to enter our borders. Welcome to our empire. Welcome to the Light."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_BORDER_OPEN_SELECT_1: "You are going to open borders to us...? Aren't your borders always open to us already anyway?\n\nDuring the war, we literally crossed your borders so pardon me if...\n\nApologies. That was impolite of us. We appreciate your gesture even though technically that is totally needless."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_BORDER_OPEN_ACCEPT_1: "The [from.GetName] has opened their borders to us again. Uhhh..cheers?\n\nTa'lak! This is all so strange for us. We should have studied this cycle further.\n\nDid you know how it was like back then? Our first children, the ones you called the Fallen Empires we believe. Did you ever wonder why they always ignore border restrictions? Exactly!"

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_BORDER_CLOSE_PROPOSE_1: "Regrettly, by your recent actions, the Hand has deemed that your empire is presently not allowed to enter our borders. Not sure why you have to follow this rule though, we have not been utilizing automated intruder ejection systems since 695.451 years ago when weird space dragons called Ether Drakes kept trying to enter our systems.\n\nBut the system was too effective, it has thrown away 97.26% of their total populations off the galaxy."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_BORDER_CLOSE_SELECT_1: "You are closing border access to our empires? Hmm..we did not know your empire has invented a stealth-based intruder ejection systems. Or perhaps you are using new types of technologies that we have not seen before?\n\nOur Hunter Escorts have reported that they did not detect any changes to your system's defensive capabilities or security measures that would have prevented our fleets from entering them. Perhaps some kind of anti-molecular barrier or null fields are used? Puzzling."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_BORDER_CLOSE_ACCEPT_1: "Very well then, our Hunters have confirmed that your border restriction systems are ineffective.\n\nWe will try our best to pretend that we cannot enter your borders. out of respect. Perhaps your security system is still damaged from the last war? Our Lightsmiths stand ready to repair them for you should you really prefer us to not enter your borders."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_1: "Your empire just turned from one of the greatest crisis this galaxy has ever known to a meme-generating empire. How does it feel? How about full of sheet, is that a meme?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_2: "Original? Progenitor? Make up your mind! Why do you have so many dumb titles."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_3: "We knew the hidden truth. Deep inside, you knew another language. We knew you used to use this language so often that it became a meme. And that language was one from the planet called Earth.\n\nYou cannot escape our abilities to grasp beyond the concept of time."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_4: "Gotta ask...why space elves? Aren't they usually extremely arrogant fools who is loved by very few people, and have annoying accents that make you want to throw them into Skyrim's Giants at level 1 and watch them transform into a Ragdoll and flies off screen?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_5: "Insult Proposed! Greetings!\n\nI dare you to say it! SAY THAT WORD! SAY THE E-WORD!\n\nDO IT NOW NOW NOW!."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_6: "Look! Escorts! ESCORTS!\n\nOur progenitor hides in metal shrimps!\n\nTHE COWARDS!!...THE FAEULLZ!!!\n\nWe...we should take away...there metal shrimps...\n\nCHIRUUUUUUU!!!!!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_7: "Omae wa Shindeiru...."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_8: "Go home and be a family man."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_9: "Hyie Hyie boi."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_10: "Battlecruisers are OP. Nerf please."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_11: "This Great Questing thing is kinda dumb...Your new plot is dumb and too complicated...It makes me want to like you.\n\nI prefer when you were crazy people who pretty much nanited every worlds into oblivion at record time."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_12: "Vegeta. What does the Scouter says about the Progenitor's meme level??\n\nITS OVER NINE THOUUUSANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNND~!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_13: "We used to fear you, you know.\n\nBut Eternal Empire stuffs are kinda more overpowered than you can ever possibly imagined. They are the new trends now. The new meta.\n\nAt least you are the second most OP, so team always ban you so that the other side cannot pick."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_14: "SUCH A LUST FOR REVENGE...WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_15: "CAN ANYBODY PROVIDE ME WITH A DECENT CHALLENGE?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_16: "DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_17: "We played you like a damn FIDDLEEEEE!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_18: "You want a piece of me, boi?"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_19: "With all due respect, Prelate Original. The Originals do nut run from its enemies. Arya is their home. It is here that they will make their stand."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_20: "Why are we still here...just to suffer...\n\nWHOOOOAAA~OAAAAAHHHHH~"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_21: "OE, Stop this OE before it's too OE!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_22: "Don't worry, we will figure you out...or use the Light!!!\n\nTHATS NOT HOW THE LIGHT WORK!!!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_23: "See, Originals. We do not win wars by killing the ones we hate. but by saving the ones we love...ignore that explosion sound in the background by the way."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_24: "I am sorry, but your face looks tired from...everything."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_25: "I will not be stopped. Not by you, the Fallen Empires, the Crisises or anyone! I will rule this sector or see it burns to ashes around me!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_26: "I used to be a Pregenitor like you, then I took a naked corvette to the knee.\n\nSince then, patrolling the galaxy almost makes me wish for a tachyon winter.\n\nWHERE IS SHAUNN??? SHAUUUUUUNNN\n\nSHAUUUUUNN!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_SELECT_27: "Seriously, why do you suddenly started talking about all these cookings all of a sudden. This is like a 180-turn plot twist...like YOU THOUGHT WE WERE EVIL, BUT NO WE WERE ACTUALLY MISUNDERSTOOD VILLIAN WHOS ACTUALLY A VERY NICE GUY."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_PROPOSE_1: "We are technically incapable of insulting you due to limitations on the game's coding...but we just did. So uhhh...go to hell."

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_GETIT_1: "We can see you are hovering on the insult button. You should know that there are currently over 27 insult messages written against us. Which is it going to be this time?"

01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_1: "E X C E L L E N T!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_2: "G R E E T I N G S!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_3: "Nani!???"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_4: "Skyrim belongs to the NORD!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_5: "This is a mod made by Chirumiru, of course its going to be infested with memes.\n\nBut if we work together, we can determine his location then make the final strike that will end his patreon page and...wait no..that would mean we won't be getting any new contents! Crap."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_6: "Ugh, who wrote all these stupid memes. Must be that PeerawatZ guy...or is it Chirumiru? No wait, that would be ShiRoZ. Dear god this guy must be an anime fanboy."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_7: "I am not totally sure how to best respond to these stuffs.\n\nHmmm...alright, this will do...\n\nFUS RO DAH!!!!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_8: "By your actions, you have now generated a net worth of -200 opinion malus towards our empire. But since the score is hidden and we are Enigmatic because we are the secretive bunch. Your attempts have ultimately failed. I WIN!"
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_9: "At least you are not using that Mike Tyson Beam from the Gigaman Mod."
01_ORIGINAL_EMPIRE_INSULT_ACCEPT_10: "Now this is kinda unfair. Your empire can generate up to 27 types of insults against us. Yet we have only up to 10 to reply back..and most of them are short as hell.\n\nWe demand a refund!"
