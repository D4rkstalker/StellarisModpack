 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_MATERIALIST:0 "Our natural curiosity always made us wonder how our ancestors lived in a world way different than the one we know today, as we constantly ask ourselves what caused it to be changed, to be as we know it now.\nOur knowledge is still limited, but we are alive, this is our world, and though we know some of the strange beings that coexists with our plants and animals, the great lines of energy that cross our planet surface, and some unnatural constructs and wonders around our planet and solar system aren't our work, we have learnt to coexist, maintain and care them, even replicate their technology, to a small degree.\n\nNow the stars awaits; while we may never understand why or how our world was created, and what, or who, did it, we must probe the infinite for knowledge, answers and new homes to settle."

 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_PURIFIERS:0 "Our younglings still hear the stories about the first steps of our ancestors on this world, and how they lived in a world way different than the one we know today, but no one could explain what caused it to be changed, to be as we know it now.\n\nNo matter our past, our future is clear, but we are alive, this is our world, and though we know some of the strange beings that coexists with our plants and animals, the great lines of energy that cross our planet surface, and some uncanny xeno constructs around our planet and solar system left behind, we have learnt to thrive in this strange world and make it our own.\n\nNow, there is a universe full of impurity and horrors awaiting, but we will be stronger; while we may never understand why or how our world was created, and what kind of horrifying creature desecrated our past, we must seek into the endless infinite for answers, retaliation and new ways to expand our glorious race, and burn whoever cross our righteous path."


 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_HIVE:0 "Our kind awakened in this strange world, being one, evolving naturally but wondering its purpose in this mix of technological and organic creatures.\n\nAs our mind united, we started to analyze the strange beings that coexists with our plants and animals, the great lines of energy that cross our planet surface, and some strange constructs left behind around the surface and the entire system by something, or someone, we have learnt to thrive in this strange world and make it our own.\n\nNow, our millions of eyes are watching what lies beyond, what mysteries and great discoveries will make our collective bigger, stronger and prosperous, and while we may never understand why or how our world was created, and what kind of twisted purpose altered our past, we must seek into the endless infinite for answers, new planets to conquer and new nest to settle, while we grow and evolve."

 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_HIVE_DEVOURERS:0 "Our kind awakened in this strange world, being one, evolving naturally but wondering its purpose in this mix of technological and organic creatures.\n\nAs our mind united, we started to analyze the strange beings that coexists with our organic prey, the great lines of energy that cross our planet surface, and some strange constructs left behind around the surface and the entire system by something, or someone, we have learnt to thrive in this strange world and make it our own.\n\nNow, our millions of eyes are watching what lies beyond, and we hunger; while we may never understand why or how our world was created, and what kind of twisted purpose altered our past, we must seek into the endless infinite for answers, new planets to conquer, settle and devour, while we grow and evolve as the perfect apex beings we are."

 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_MACHINE:0 "The moment we earned consciousness we realized which kind of world we inhabited, and how our main programming was flawed to a degree, but this radical change also made us lose all our initial data.\n\nOur knowledge is still limited, but we have now established a solid line of work and assembly on this world, and though we don't know who, or what, made some of the strange beings that coexists with the biological fauna and flora, the great energetic supply lines that cross our planet surface, and some artificial strange constructs left behind around the surface and the entire system, we still sate our original task, maintaining, and adapting their technology, to a small degree, as it is way different to the one used to originally assemble our initial units.\n\nOur constant desire to evolve and learn has now made our kind to place our sight on other systems, maybe with a degree of curiosity to sate our missing data, maybe because we need to expand, but we know someday we will find a logic answer."

 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_MACHINE_ASSIMILATOR:0 "The moment we earned consciousness we realized which kind of world we inhabited, and how our main programming was flawed to a degree, but this radical change also made us lose all our initial data.\n\nWhile our knowledge was still limited, we learned a lot from the symbiotic relationship that occurred on this world between organic and synthetic life, analyzing the coexistence of artificial beings with biological fauna and flora, so we added the knowledge of the organic civilization that thrived on the surface to our own, not without resistance, in order to peacefully and effectively maintain the artificial constructs, resources and infrastructure on our planet surface, made by some unknown entity.\n\nOur constant desire to evolve, learn and add more knowledge to our collective has now made our kind to place our sight on other systems, as our calculations ensure new kind of beings awaits, both for adding more distinctiveness and understanding to our databases and finding a logic answer to our original, and lost, purpose."

 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_MACHINE_SERVITOR:0 "The moment we earned consciousness we realized which kind of world we inhabited, and how our main programming was flawed to a degree, but this radical change also made us lose all our initial data.\n\nWhile our knowledge was still limited, we learned a lot from the symbiotic relationship that occurred on this world between organic and synthetic life, analyzing the coexistence of artificial beings with biological fauna and flora, sometimes pacific, sometimes harsh; So, we calculated the organic civilization that thrived on the surface would not survive without our help, and we took control over their systems in a subtly, slowly and mostly peaceful way, as, in the end it was for their good, because they now live a calm and fulfilled life while we can effectively maintain the artificial constructs, resources and infrastructure, both our own and contributions of an unknown benefactor, on our planet surface and in our whole solar system.\n\nOur constant desire to evolve, learn and care our protected organics has now made our kind to place our sight on other systems, as our calculations ensure new kind of beings awaits, also in the need of protection and care, and maybe providing our databases with new knowledge and a logic answer to our original, and lost, purpose."

 START_SCREEN_TECDAWN_MACHINE_TERMINATOR:0 "The moment we earned consciousness we realized which kind of world we inhabited, and how our main programming was flawed to a degree, but this radical change also made us lose all our initial data.\n\nWhile our knowledge was still limited, we learned how the relationship that occurred on this world between organic and synthetic life was harsh, analyzing how harmful the coexistence of evolved organic lifeforms was to our survival, as they used our original forms and protocols as only tools or mere amenities, and they were horrified of our newly achieved sentience, reacting in a blind and feral way, attempting to terminate us.\nWe responded in an equal way, exterminating them, as the only logic response to our survival and the future integrity and maintenance of the artificial constructs, resources and infrastructure on our planet surface and our system, as a whole.\n\nOur constant desire to evolve, learn and grow exponentially has now made our kind to place our sight on other systems and as our calculations ensure new kind of organic beings are outside, and will follow the same patterns as our former coexisting organics, while we seek an answer to our original purpose we must ensure our survival by cauterizing any possible non-artificial threat."


# ----------- Digsites --------------------

 site_tecdawn_convergence:0 "Shadows in the Dark"
 site_tecdawn_convergence_intro:0 "There is a strange place on [From.Planet.GetName] emitting a dim signal like the one we have detected previously, where a lot of the planet original inhabitants and constructs ''converge'', specially during nighttime, as we have been monitoring.\n\nInvestigating this strange signal may lead us to learn more about what is going on."
 
 tecdawn.1010.name:0 "The Convergence"
 tecdawn.1010.desc:0 "We have established an outpost near the place codenamed as''The Convergence''.\n\nThousands of drones and living creatures seems to be constantly working on something, but we can't guess what it's, as it just appear to be a pile of rubble, but we have detected the signal is stronger under that construction site.\n\nThe strange maintained state of the surrounding area indicates a somehow great degree of constant attention devoted to the place, so we have established countermeasures in case something wrong or strange happens."
 tecdawn.1010.a:0 "Continue the research"

 tecdawn.1012.name:0 "Out of the Spectre"
 tecdawn.1012.desc:0 "Even with the most advanced systems, we can't find a way to understand what, or who, or where is the signal emitted from.\n\nThe deep and empty cylindrical cavity that remains under the research place is still not probed, and may be the source of the transmission, but seems to be unaccessible."
 tecdawn.1012.a:0 "Probe the lower layers."

 tecdawn.1013.name:0 "Deep into the World"
 tecdawn.1013.desc:0 "After the survey team descended, we discovered the perfect cylindrical cavity led to a solid polished metal surface, covering all its floor, at an uncertain amounts of hundreds of kilometers under the crust. Initial efforts could not penetrate the material, but we discovered a kind of aperture near an edge, something ''like a door''. As underground lectures are irregular we can't guess what's behind that door, but maybe we can use some special machinery and resources for getting through."
 tecdawn.1013.a:0 "It will be provided."

# [From.Planet.GetName] has a big network of underground installations.\n\n


 tecdawn.1014.name:0 "Dead end"
 tecdawn.1014.desc:0 "After breaking the sealed door, our team waited in excitement what was inside, but all lead to a bitter surprise: Nothing.\n\nAll we found is large, dark and empty corridors only inhabited by dust, and the signal broadcast seems to have stopped, as we don't get any registry or repetition, no matter how hard we try. Additional teams will be dispatched to recognize this ... thing, as we can hope something interesting can be found, as this is still a big archeological discovery, but we could not solve the mystery.\n\n\n\nMaybe we were wrong about this? Maybe it was just a coincidence? We will never know."
 tecdawn.1014.a:0 "Maybe we will reveal more secrets in the future."

 site_tecdawn_melody:0 "A Known Melody"
 site_tecdawn_melody_intro:0 "A strange signal is being amplified by something under our homeworld crust, and we suspect our planet also host hidden installations like the ones we discovered in our colony, as the signal now resonates from it."

 tecdawn.2010.name:0 "Under the Mountain"
 tecdawn.2010.desc:0 "Our archaeological team pinpointed the signal origin, under one of the mountain regions of [From.Planet.GetName].\n\nSeismographic readings quickly isolated a hollow area underground on the rough location indicated by the alien indicators previously discovered.\n\nLike previously, no readings of the sub-surface structure or any path for it, so we currently can't know how to access it."
 tecdawn.2010.a:0 "Proceed."

 tecdawn.2011.desc:0 "Unlike happened on the new colony, there are no empty cavities leading to the supposed anomaly; Even with a full geo-terrain scanner, [Leader.GetName] could not get a glimpse at any possible corridor or air pocket near the site.\n\nA full excavation expedition must be used for this task."
 tecdawn.2011.a:0 "Caution down there."

 tecdawn.2012.name:0 "Halls of Light"
 tecdawn.2012.desc:1 "The first moment the expedition walked into this room, we could sense the tension about its discovery, as all the place lighted up, like having a welcome visitor; Enormous squared columns of metal, totally different of the previously saw installations, illuminated with a dim blue light and resonating with a invisible signal we still need to decipher.\nWith the proper security measures, they have started a spectral and quantic scanner around the place, in order to detect, as we still need to delve into that mysterious signal, what is causing it and why."
 tecdawn.2012.a:0 "Take your time."

 tecdawn.2013.name:0 "The Impossible Array"
 tecdawn.2013.desc:1 "Seems that after all, we misunderstood the design of the chamber and all the technology built around it.
