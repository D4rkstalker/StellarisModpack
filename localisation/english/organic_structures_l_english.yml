 job_larva_queen:0 "Brood Queen"
 job_larva_queen_plural:0 "Brood Queens"
 job_larva_queen_desc:0 "A mature Queen seasonally produces winged virgin queens and males, called alates. Unfertilized eggs develop into males. Fertilized eggs usually develop into wingless, sterile workers, but may develop into virgin queens if the larvae receive special attention."

 START_SCREEN_ORGANIC_STRUCTURES:0 "While individual organisms usually show little phenotypic variations, our species evolved in such a way that our phenotypic plasticity allow our larvae to radically change their morphology and aglomerate.\n\nAt first, this evolutionary trait created disarray between our species, but, as we gained conciousness, we embraced our differences.\n\nOur phenotypic plasticity proved to be advantageous when it came to overcoming the odds life presents. The Queen phenotype evolved as a means to grow new larvae, an efficient way to grow the Hive, while others where aglomerated into buildings, ships, complex drones or working force.\n\nNow we look at the stars pondering what to do next.\n\nWe are the collective, we are all."

 organic_structures_normal_desc:0 "A balanced colony is a healthy colony.\nBrood Queens: Pop Growth Speed: §G+2.5%§!"
 organic_structures_alates:0 "Nuptial Flights"
 organic_structures_alates_desc:0 "The lack of larvae is a problem, regular nuptial flights help Brood Queens lay more alate larvae which will help the colony expand and grow."
 organic_structures_workers:0 "Sterile Workers"
 organic_structures_workers_desc:0 "If the Brood seems to have enough alate larvae, it can opt to produce more workforce by reducing the amount of nuptial flights to zero, which will leave the larvae sterile and never be able to morph into any building or ship.\nBrood Queens: Pop Growth Speed: §G+5%§!"
