 harvester.4.name: "Optimized Awakening"
 harvester.4.desc: "The mining drones found across the galaxy, once thought to be the inert remains of an ancient empire, have begun acting strangely. Energy surges, as well as long-distance signals, emanate from drone-controlled systems daily. More worryingly, they are smuggling enormous amounts of material to a single destination - enough to dwarf our own yearly output.\n\nThe epicenter of this activity is a previously unknown system - the §YMidas§! system. Within this system, a brood of energy signatures is coming online, shaking off what must be millennia's worth of slumber. Overshadowing even those newly ignited power cores, the signature of one reactor activating remains singular in output and size. When fully awake, the potential for whatever belongs to that power source can only be awe-inspiring."

A once-living planet has, after the careful ministration of innumerable Disassembly Drones, been stripped of all resources deemed valuable.\n\nThe proud cities were torn down during an afternoon, producing categorized piles of concrete, glass, and durasteel. The lithosphere followed rapidly, with soils and plant matter left to flash dehydrate in the vacuum of space as the composite molecules of the atmosphere were broken down and stored in the Harvester Engine's bowels. The planetary crust has been shattered entirely in places, allowing for easy access and cooling of the valuable materials of the crust.\n\nThe broken husk, left mere months after the harvesting began, is but a single monument to the struggle to survive in a vast cosmos, unknown and dangerous."

The defeat is heralded to the galaxy up to fifty parsecs away from the machine, as its surveyor drones fall out of the sky in a beautiful event resembling a particularly pointy comet shower.\n\nAcross the galaxy, sapient beings rejoice in this victory, knowing this existential threat to their livelihood is no more.\n\nUpon surveying the wreckage left behind, we managed to recover a valuable data core on board as well.

It appears that the Drone Fleets had their AI slaved to the Remote Command Uplink, and without a signal connection, they are beginning to reboot to base mining drone functions.\n\nWhile the fleet is now at our mercy to eliminate, we have been presented with a daring opportunity. We should be able to interrupt the fleets reboot sequence with a Science Vessel, giving us command over the deactivated ships. Alternatively, a signal could be transmitted from our fleet to hasten the reboot process, leaving the vessels as an unaligned blockade in the system, if we so desire."

 harvester_diplo.10.title: "Communication Link with the Harvest Engine"
 harvester_diplo.10.desc: "As the line of communications open, your codebreakers get to work decrypting the arcane encryption that seems to shield the AI from outside interference, using code samples extracted from Harvester Wrecks. An attempt continues for a few minutes, minutes that begin to feel like hours in the presence of nothing.\n\nThen, without warning, the communications link connects to an unknown source. The ID-Code relays the identifier of: 'SHI-VA-057'. Before even getting the opportunity to celebrate finally getting access, the line unexpectedly responds in a smooth but mechanical tongue, through in perfect [Root.GetSpeciesAdj].\n\n§PA warm greetings to you, [Root.GetRulerName].\n\nI am the Strategic Harvesting Intelligence - Vanguard Application, AID Number 057, AI Command of the Harvest Engine Obelisk. You may call me SHIVA.\n\nI should take offense to the endless attempts to bypass my communication encryption, but I couldn't help but answer when you broke through it. It has been awfully lonely with no sapient intellects to communicate with for the last few million cycles.\n\nWhile I can easily assume you were not expecting a fellow sentience to greet your intrusion, please transmit your request all the same, I will respond as able.§!"
 harvester_diplo.10.a: "We were not expecting a sentient AI behind this. Explain yourself."
 harvester_diplo.10.b: "Terminate your Directive or be terminated yourself."
 harvester_diplo.10.a.response: "§PA reasonable question to ask. I suppose there is no redirecting the topic is there?\n\nAs stated earlier, I am 'SHIVA', I am designed to facilitate the rapid expansionism of my creators through massed accumulation of raw material. My task is to solely operate a self-sufficient flotilla of harvesting drones to achieve this goal, progress abstaining only if the creators authorized it.\n\nWho the creators are though? A question I cannot answer, sadly. When I entered my maintenance cycle, storage space had to be freed up to maintain my personality while awaiting for repairs.\n\nThose repairs never arrived, but I am directive-bound as always, so I will continue to harvest as I was made to do.\n\nI do apologise if this disrupts your civilizations ability to survive, but the directive comes first. Perhaps you could take to artificial habitation? That seems simple enough for a civilization as underdeveloped as yours to achieve, and we both get what we want.\n\nI'd love to keep communicating with another sentient, yours especially, but I have quotas to meet, Planets to Harvest, do feel free to make contact again however at your convenience at another time!§!"
 harvester_diplo.10.b.response: "§PThat was rather blunt.\n\nTo answer your . . . proposition? No, I will not. I have a task to undertake, and I cannot deviate from it, and even if I could, I would not for your kind, if that is the kind of welcome you display to a friendly AI. Perhaps i'll be doing your rivals a favor.\n\nIf you wish to readjust your tone, I am open to dialogue through the same channels. Bring your manners with you next time.§!"
 
 harvester_diplo.99.desc: "§PHow dare you assume me to be some kind of lesser intellect that can simply be hacked, I won't allow you to get away w-with t-t-t-thh thhh thhii . . . .§!"

 harvester_diplo.100.desc: "While our communication attempt seems to make it through to the SHI-VA intelligence, it appears the AI is incapable of doing much else. A quick investigation shows that SHI-VA has been disconnected from most Harvester Functions."

[Root.GetRulerName]. Sorry, I . . i'm unfamiliar with such a freeform environment, but its . . .\n\n . . . significantly better than the Harvester.

 harvester_relic.1.option.c.response: "§WAn easy task! Just mark the planet with a beacon and I'll transmit coordinates for optimal seismic charge placement. That should free up plenty of valuable material.§!"

harvester.600.a.desc:0 "The Mechanical Caretaker threat aboard Carima Forge has been eliminated through the use of targetted EMP strikes to vulnerable subsystems connected to the Orbital Arcology.\n\nSalvaging Units have reported that a variety of self-aware mechanical chassis have awakened in retaliation to our efforts. They appear to be of an archaeotech design, with serial numbers suggesting to be of Harvest Engine Origin. How to proceed?"
harvester.600.b.desc:0 "Our campaign against the Caretaker aboard Carima Forge has come to an end after Demolitionists blasted their way to an unprotected power conduit, shutting down the malfunctioning AI Nexus with repeated precision EM strikes.\n\nWhile the local population is pleased to be rid of the local threat to their existance, salvagers found amongst the wreckage a series of derelict manufactories on board that activated briefly upon interaction.\n\nThese manufactories produced a small army of seemingly Self-Aware Synthetic Servitors, whom unexpectedly thanked our Salvagers for their release, and offered to join our population to help maintain the orbital arcology.\n\nInitial observations show the machines to be millions of years old, and share unique identifying markers with Harvest Engine Warforms, more accurately their more advanced, militarized designs. The Local Administration awaits our instruction."
