 mind_mend.2600.name:0 "Mind Coalescence"
 mind_mend.2600.desc:0 "Since we gained consciousness, our synaptic drones reported cases of drones wielding powers that can only be described as supernatural in nature. Until recently, these cases were just disregarded or misunderstood,.\n\nNow, however, our brain drones have finally obtained conclusive evidence that proves the psionic potential inherent in certain [Root.GetSpeciesName] drones. Although only a very small minority of our species as a whole seems to be gifted with psionic powers, their numbers relative to the total population have grown steadily over just the last few centuries.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of sudden evolutionary growth-spurt or because something has triggered latent psionic abilities that were always present in our genetic code, brain drones cannot say.\n\nThese new powers allow us to briefly connect our collective consciousness into the minds of other species."

This must be a fairly recent development, since we have no record of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ever displaying psionic abilities on file.\n\n[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] in the §Y[From.GetName]§! has offered no explanation."
 
 
 mind_mend.2650.name:0 "The Great Awakening"
 mind_mend.2650.desc:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] species has experienced what can only be described as a Great Awakening. For a time now, we have been aware of the great psionic potential inherent in our species, but such powers have only manifested themselves in a small minority... until now.\n\nAlmost overnight, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] everywhere have unlocked their full psionic capacity. It is as if some sort of communal pool of [Root.GetSpeciesName] psychic energy finally reached a critical tipping point, collectively awakening the latent abilities of our brains.\n\nTelepathy has already replaced most verbal communication between [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and this is only one small example of the innumerable changes our society is faced with. We are now tied with the universe in a way we could have ever imagined." 
 mind_mend.2650.a:0 "Our power increases!"
 mind_mend.2652.name:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] Awaken Psionic Abilities"
 mind_mend.2652.desc:0 "All [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] throughout the galaxy have undergone a great change. Whereas before their latent psionic power had only blossomed in a small minority, the entire species has now unlocked its full psychic potential.\n\nAlthough these changes seem to have originated in the [From.GetName], they have now manifested in all members of their species regardless of where they reside. We predict that with enough psionic power, a collective mind like [From.GetName] could, theoretically, have the power to remotely submit others to their will. What does this mean for the rest of the galaxy remains to be seen."
