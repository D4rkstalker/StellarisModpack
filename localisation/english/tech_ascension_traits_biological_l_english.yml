    tech_ascension_traits_biological_1:0 "Genetic Optimization"
    tech_ascension_traits_biological_1_desc:1 "Although natural evolution served us well, it is time to simplify the unnecessarily complex gene sequences. The procedure should allow the genome to store genetic information more efficiently."
    tech_ascension_traits_biological_2:0 "Selective Gene Enhancer"
    tech_ascension_traits_biological_2_desc:1 "We can enhance the abilities of individuals by stimulating parts of the genetic structure."
    tech_ascension_traits_biological_3:0 "Plasmids"
    tech_ascension_traits_biological_3_desc:1 "Artificial bio-stimulants, also called Plasmids can activate dormant, unstable genes in our species. However, a constant supply of bio-stabilizers is usually required to avoid harmful mutations in the heavily altered cellular structures."
