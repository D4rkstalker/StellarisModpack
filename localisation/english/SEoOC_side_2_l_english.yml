 nep_whitegoo.5000.desc:0 "§Y[From.Solar_system.GetName]§! suddenly has some strange white goo. This white goo will interfere with the efficiency of our fleet's propulsions, and the planet's acceptance of solar light reduction may lead to power generation efficiency. And these white goo produce some strange resonances that cause some equipment to operate abnormally. This white goo seems to gradually spread between galaxies and may become a new threat."
