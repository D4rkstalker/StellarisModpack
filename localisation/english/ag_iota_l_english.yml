The $ag_ancient_civilization_iota_name$ data indicates that such an energy source usually consists of a high-dimensional site and an AI with psionic awareness, if you can find a way to interact with the ancient AI located in the high-dimensional, maybe you can make it stop the current aggressive behavior.

The weak $ag_divine$ needed energy, and they took a fancy to the $ag_ancient_civilization_iota_name$, whose psionic technology was not as powerful as $ag_zroni_civilization$ at that time, and a war broke out between the two sides. $ag_ancient_civilization_iota_name$ called those remaining consciousness as Shroud Invaders.\n\nThe war ended with a victory for $ag_ancient_civilization_iota_name$, but instead of destroying the Shroud Invaders, $ag_ancient_civilization_iota_name$ pulled it out of the $ag_shroud$ and disassembled it into pieces to store in some $pc_ringworld_habitable$, one of which is now attacking our system."
 ag_iota.417.c.2:0 "How should we deal with the Shroud Invader?"
 ag_iota.417.c.2.response:0 "Fragments of the Shroud Invaders are nowhere near as powerful as they used to be, $ag_ancient_civilization_iota_name$ doesn't have much to explain but we can still find that psionic entities with low energy levels can be destroyed with enough firepower - meaning we can just attack and destroy the psionic entities of the Shroud Invaders.\n\nAs for psionic portals, intense psionic activity makes it impossible for ships to pass through them, but they are equally vulnerable to conventional weapons and stabilized until ships can pass through, though they have special defense mechanisms. The secondary psionic portal is protected by surrounding starbases, you must destroy the surrounding star bases first, while the main psionic portal requires all entrances to be stabilized before it can be safely passed, and its exit needs to be stabilized to return.\n\nDestroyed ships will be transformed into small psionic entities, so you should minimize the loss of vulnerable small ships when engaging the Shroud Invaders.
