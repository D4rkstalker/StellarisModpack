 # Infestation
 EMBRYO_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We see a host, Eggs, eggs, eeeeeeeggsssss."
 EMBRYO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are the [Root.GetName]. Your bodies are our wombs, egg"
 EMBRYO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "More Eggs, yes yes yeeeees"
 EMBRYO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Did you know that when a larva enters your body it starts eating you while still alive?"
 EMBRYO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Just wondering, how mane hosts, I mean, population does your empire have?"
 EMBRYO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] greets you, [From.GetRulerTitle]. Although you are not part of us, you will come to know that we value our friends as well, as long as they are useful."
 EMBRYO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Ignore [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural], it is simply an orphan child, maybe take it home? Perhaps? It needs a family."
 EMBRYO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "You do understand the importance of the body, we need them, we are them."
 EMBRYO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "We apolgize for infesting some of your ships that have entered our space, they wanted to be infested, just ask them... oh..."
 EMBRYO_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We will infest you, [From.GetSpeciesName]. You will become one with us."
 EMBRYO_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We are the voice, join us, be us."
 EMBRYO_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Where a life is taken, a new one is born."
 EMBRYO_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "All we see in you are embryos ready to hatch."
 EMBRYO_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We are not threatend by the likes of you."
 EMBRYO_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] are nothing but an aberration to natures way."
 EMBRYO_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Have the [Root.GetName] heard about organic bodies? Perhaps you would like a new kind of body... warmer.. nurturing.."
 EMBRYO_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName] EGGSSSSSS!! EEEGGGGSSSSSS!"
 EMBRYO_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Why do we call you Eggs you must wonder, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Well, you see, we see you as part of us, yet not enough to call you our children, you are an egg that will hatch pretty soon"
 EMBRYO_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We will get those bodies, [From.GetSpeciesName]. And we will use them as we please."
 EMBRYO_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Come come now, the process does not hurt. We will just lay eggs inside your bodies, they will grow consuming all the nutrients you provide. Rest assured you will be well fed. The offspring will grow inside you, it will feed on you keeping you alive while it still grows, at least most of the time... some other times the host just dies. After it is mature enough it will start digging its way out eating and tearing apart bone and tissue alike. Once its out it will feed on the remains of your body, nothing will be wasted. A life ends, a life begins, Egg."
 EMBRYO_MECH_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Tin can, is there anywhere we can lay our eggs?"

 EMBRYO_DOW_PROPOSE:0 "You will be infested, our larva have already been launched towards your nearest colony."
 EMBRYO_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "We have determined that [From.GetSpeciesName] will make viable hosts. Prepare to be parasatized."
 EMBRYO_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "Did you really think that you could stop the spread of the [Root.GetName]. You are fools, and you will be us."
 EMBRYO_DOW_ACCEPT:0 "The [Root.GetName] cannot be stopped. You will join us, your biomass will sustain us, your knowledge will be ours."
 EMBRYO_DOW_ACCEPT_01:0 "The spread of the [Root.GetName] cannot be stopped. Resistance is useless, you will be us."
 EMBRYO_DOW_ACCEPT_02:0 "Come to us, [From.GetSpeciesName]. You will be infested. One corpses, no grave."
 EMBRYO_MECH_DOW_ACCEPT:0 "Machines can be infested just like anything else, right?."
 EMBRYO_CONSIDER_01:0 "This proposal may aid in the spread of the [Root.GetName]."

 EMBRYO_PEACE_ACCEPT:0 "We have infested a sufficent amount of [From.GetSpeciesName] for our needs, for now. However, our larva will never be stopped."
 EMBRYO_MECH_PEACE_ACCEPT:0 "We tire of infesting cold metal cases such as yourself, the galaxy is filled with fresh organic hosts."
 EMBRYO_PEACE_REFUSE:0 "Why would we stop? The [From.GetSpeciesName] are perfect hosts for the [Root.GetName]. We will continue to breed, your foolish efforts to stop us are fruitless."
 EMBRYO_MECH_PEACE_REFUSE:0 "We will not relent. Not while the machines still occupy infestable land."

 EMBRYO_ASK_JOIN_A_ACCEPT:0 "We will temporaliy aid you, future hosts. Welcome to our temporary alliance."
 EMBRYO_ASK_JOIN_A_REFUSE:1 "You are far more useful as hosts than as allies. You will be infested, soon."
 EMBRYO_LEAVE_A_SELECT:0 "The [Root.GetName] still finds this alliance beneficial to our spread, are you sure you wish to end it, future hosts?"
 EMBRYO_LEAVE_A_PROPOSE:0 "This alliance no longer benefits our spread, we must end it."
 EMBRYO_LEAVE_A_ACCEPT:0 "Very well. You are better hosts than allies anyway, the time will come when your species will be infested just like all the others."
 EMBRYO_DEMAND_VASS_SELECT:0 "You seek to temporaily limit the spread of the [Root.GetName] in exchange for our temporary protection, and other benfits?"
 EMBRYO_DEMAND_VASS_PROPOSE:0 "The unity of the [From.GetName] has stood the test of time. We will temporarily protect the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] from destruction. However this is only temporary eventually you §Rwill!§ be infested."
 EMBRYO_DEMAND_VASS_ACCEPT:0 "We have determined that this arrangement will benefit our spread. The [Root.GetName] shall spread and flourish under the protective hand of [From.GetRulerName]. Until the time comes that you can no longer aid our spread. Remember, eventually you §Rwill!§ be infested like all others."
 EMBRYO_DEMAND_VASS_REFUSE:0 "We refuse to be contained. You could never contain the spread of the [Root.GetName]. You will be infested."
 EMBRYO_ASK_FOR_VASS_SELECT:0 "You are prepared to be temporarily cultivated and protected by the [Root.GetName] before the time comes that your species must be integrated into our greater mind?"
 EMBRYO_ASK_FOR_VASS_PROPOSE:0 "Your temporary protection would aid in our spread, do you accept?"
 EMBRYO_ASK_FOR_VASS_ACCEPT:0 "We have deliberated and accepted. The [From.GetName] shall be cultivated until the day comes that we feel it is more profitable to infest them."
 EMBRYO_ASK_FOR_VASS_REFUSE:0 "We do not protect, we only infest, are you prepared to be infested?"
