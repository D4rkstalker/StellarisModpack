 evt_primitive_mechanists: "Early Robots"
 evt_primitive_mechanists_desc: "Thanks to approaching the project with extraordinary enthusiasm, the inhabitants of [From.Capital.GetName] appear to have developed robotic workers at an exceptionally early point in their general technological progress. Such robots are beginning to replace living workers in a wide variety of roles in their mines and farms."
 evt_primitive_mechanists_desc_spiritualist: "The native inhabitants of [From.Capital.GetName], who have long lacked respect for the natural order, have nonetheless fallen below our expectation by devoloping and widely manufacturing mechanical mockeries of life at a level of technology at which most civilizations would think such task not only morally abhorrent but also wildly technologically infeasible"
 evt_primitive_mechanists.spiritualists: "Let us prey they see the error of their ways"

 evt_primitive_machine_nuking: "Machine Takeover"
 evt_primitive_machine_nuking_desc: "The native biological civilization of [From.Capital.GetName] is no more. It seems a prototype artificial intelligence managed to take control of the planet's robotic workers and launched the planet's entire stockpile of nuclear weapons in order to eliminate organic competition"
 evt_primitive_machine_nuking.spiritualists: "They have reaped the fruits of their hubris"

 evt_primitive_machine_takover: "Machine Takeover"
 evt_primitive_machine_takover_desc: "The native biological civilization of [From.Capital.GetName] is no more. It seems a prototype artificial intelligence managed to take control of the planet's robotic workers, beginning a war against its creators which resulted in the extinction of the latter."

 evt_primitive_machine_service: "Machine Takeover"
 evt_primitive_machine_service_desc: "In the decades since we begun observing [From.Capital.Getname], its society has undergone a dramatic transition. As their robots have been made more intelligent and interconnected, they have taken over increasing amounts of society from their organic creators. It has now reached the point where the planet's biological population live in idle luxury, wholly reliant on their robots for all material needs, while their civilization is ruled and maintained by a rudimentary but slowly self-improving machine intelligence"

 evt_primitive_machine_assimilation: "Machine Takeover"
 evt_primitive_machine_assimilation_desc: "The native civilization of [From.Capital.Getname] has undergone a disturbing transformation. A prototype AI has taken control of the planet's robotic workers, and proceeded to forcibly assimilate the planet's population into a gestalt consciousness under its control using surprisingly sophisticated neural implants. Almost all entirety of the planet's living population are now cybernetic drones."

 evt_nuclear_survivors: "[From.GetName] Descends Into Nuclear War"

 evt_necrophage_takeover: "[From.GetName] Infected"
 evt_necrophage_takeover_desc: "A profound change has overtaken the primitive civilization of [necroid_planet.GetName]. We had thought the planet inhabited by a single sapient species, the [From.GetSpeciesName]. It seems that something else was sharing the planet in secret; the [necroid_country.GetSpeciesName], hosts of a parasite which radically alters the physiology and psychology of the host, and drives them to spread the infection. After centuries of gatherting strength in secret, the infected have finally revealed themselves, and quickly deposed the [From.GetSpeciesName] governments of the world, establishing themselves as the new rulers of the planet."
 evt_necrophage_takeover_post_invasion: "Necrophages seize control of [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System"
 evt_necrophage_takeover_post_invasion_desc: "It seems that our invasion plans for [Root.GetName] overlooked a crucial variable; unbeknownst either to us or to most of the planet's natives, [Root.GetName] was inhabited by a secretive race of sapient parasites who reproduce by assimilating members of other species.\nIt seems certain members of this species saw our invasion as an opportunity, and managed to capture and assimilate several of our high-ranking agents on the planet in order to learn access codes to our ships and starbases. This faction have now seized control of the [Root.Solar_System_GetName] system and proclaimed independence."


 evt_primitive_seti_atomic_age: "Splitting the Atom"
 evt_primitive_seti_atomic_age_desc: "The alien civilization on [From.Capital.GetName] have managed to split the atom. They appear to have been working from radio instructions broadcast by the [From.From.GetName] from [From.From.Capital.GetName] several years ago which finally reached [From.Capital.GetName] earlier this year. Now the first nuclear weapons are inevitably being produced and nuclear power plants are coming online. The [From.GetName] has entered the critical phase where they suddenly possess the means to destroy their own world with the press of a button."
 evt_primitive_seti_early_space_age: "First Satellite"
 evt_primitive_seti_early_space_age_desc: "Our long-range tracking systems have detected the first launch of an artificial satellite from the surface of [From.Capital.GetName]. The satellite was based on designs from [From.From.Capital.GetName], with whom the [From.GetName] have been exchanging information via radio signals. After taking these first tentative steps into space, we can expect them to launch manned missions and, eventually, interplanetary expeditions."


 evt_primitive_shift_to_authoritarian: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_authoritarian_desc: "It seems recent technological advances on [From.Capital.GetName] have largely served to strengthen the planet's monarchs, oligarchs, and dictators, who have turned new tehnologies to surveilance, indoctrination, and control of an increasingly disenfranchized lower class. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly authoritarian."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_egalitarian: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_egalitarian_desc: "It seems recent technological advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have largely served to break down social hierarchies and empower the lower classes. As knowledge and resources which were once controlled by the planet's elites have become widely available, systems of social control have failed, idealogues have spread calls for equality far and wide, and monarchs and oligarchs must increasingly either surrender their power or face revolution. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly egalitarian."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_xenophobe: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_xenophobe_desc: "It seems recent technological advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have largely served to advantage certain ethnic groups. The populations among whom the new technologies were developed have proceeded to proclaim these advances proof of their superiority over the rest of the species. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly xenophobic."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_xenophile: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_xenophile_desc: "It seems recent technological advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have lead to increasingly widespread trade and communications between ethnic groups, and a resulting growth of appreciation for each others' personhood and of appreciation for the diversity of [From.GetSpeciesName] experience. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly xenophilic."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_militarist: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_militarist_desc: "It seems recent technological advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have lead to incresingly widespread and brutal warfare, as advances in weaponry and transportation have destabilized old balances of power and allowed warlords to seize power on increasing scales. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly militaristic."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_pacifist: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_pacifist_desc: "It seems recent technological advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have lead to a decline in warfare and rise in diplomacy; terrified by the implications of new and devastating weapons and tactics, the planet's rulers have efficiently established treaties to limit the risk of such things seeing use. Much of the public sees these measures as inadequate given the risks involved. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly pacifistic."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_spiritualist: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_spiritualist_desc: "It seems recent advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have largely been monopolized by its priesthood, who have incorporated the underlying principles on which the new technologies work into a body of secret knowledge and presented the results as proof of their spiritual power. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly religious."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_materialist: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_materialist_desc: "It seems recent advances on [From.Capital.Getname] have lead to an increasing appreciation of science and technology and abandonment of mysticism. Scholars see new discoveries as demonstrating that nature is ultimately comprehensible, and that such comprehension is at hand. The traditional claims of the planet's religeons increasingly seem inconsistent with the observed properties of the world. The planet's civilizations have become increasingly materialist."

 evt_primitive_shift_to_spiritualist_postapoc: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_spiritualist_postapoc_desc: "It seems the recent devastation of [From.Capital.Getname] has resulted in a rise in religion, the public seeing the nuclear apocalypse as demonstration of the follies of habris and proof of the need to return to more traditional ways of living."
 evt_primitive_shift_to_materialist_postapoc: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_materialist_postapoc_desc: "It seems the recent devastating nuclear war on [From.Capital.Getname] has resulted in a widespread abandonment of religion; the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] feel that any gods worthy of worship would surely have intervened to prevent such an apocalypse. The planet's civilization has become increasingly materialist"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_xenophobe_postapoc: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_xenophobe_postapoc_desc: "In the wake of devastating nuclear war on [From.Capital.Getname], surviving communities seem to have become increasingly xenophobic"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_militarist_postapoc: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_militarist_postapoc_desc: "In the wake of devastating nuclear war on [From.Capital.Getname], surviving communities seem to have become increasingly militaristic"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_pacifist_postapoc: "Social Shift in [From.Getname]"
 evt_primitive_shift_to_pacifist_postapoc_desc: "It seems that in the wake of the devastating nuclear war on [From.Capital.Getname] has given rise to a new and increasingly dominant social movement, which sees the catastrophe as proof of the folly of war and the overwhelming importance of avoiding it. The planet's civilization has become increasingly pacifist."
