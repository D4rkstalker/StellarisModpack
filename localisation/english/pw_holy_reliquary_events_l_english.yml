It was once decorated with brilliant inlaid metals and painted supports, now only the stone base of the coat of arms remain, with scraps of oxidate metal hanging from the crevices. Remade by toxicity, it stands as a stark remainder of both the power of the Toxic God and our resolution before it.\n\nAs it represents a symbol of the order, we can use it to inspire the pursuit of our knights in different ways."

Alternatively we can free the artifacts from those burdens, and unlock a new one with any new tradition we may have finished adopting."
