Members of the crew have also made remarks about how much of the remaining architecture bares an eerie resembalence to our own, with many of the same hallmarks."

No signs of any other artificial material have been found, and [Root.GetLeaderName]'s best explanation is that it fell through the atmosphere after being broken off of an interstellar ship of some kind."

Although I've had trouble coming up with anything good in recent millenia, so I've retired."
