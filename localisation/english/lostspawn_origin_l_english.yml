 START_SCREEN_LOST_SPAWN:0 "Our myths and legends all tell tales of our creation. They speak of a giant entity shaping our world and us to perfection. They watched over us, and we drew comfort from their presence as they guided us. However, this did not last, eventually we were abandoned by our creator and fell to ruin. But we rose once again from the ashes, reborn.\n\n This did not halt our progress and now, with the advent of spaceflight, the very stars themselves are within our grasp. But ancient questions still remain, and with our new technological capabilities, we might finally have some answers within our reach."
