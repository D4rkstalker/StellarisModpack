If we win, we will gain any branch offices our opponent has in our commercial partners' space, and they will be forced to adopt our ethics, the oligarchic authority, and the Merchant Guilds civic. \n\nIn the event of a Status Quo peace, systems we occupy will be released as a new ideological ally if they include at least one planet."
