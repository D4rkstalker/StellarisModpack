Outside of an harmonic, controlled and enclosed system like inside the archaic pylons, the Sentient Metal Hive Mind is essentially guide less and the efficiency of its abilities limited to only adapting after being directly damaged by environmental effects. By giving it external, superordinate orders from scanners and ship computers, we can make it more aware of its surroundings and inform it about incoming threats, so that it can adapt even faster and better."

It taps into the extreme energy content of the Everchanging and shoots a beam of focused shroud energy at its target. Fueled by the energy of more than a thousand suns, the Sentient Metal Devourer is by far the most powerful ship weapon ever seen, capable of devastating everything in its path."
