##there are two doors and a mirror
 psionic_shroud.3000.intro.desc:0 "The Shroud. It is unbelievably strange and unsettling, but also... immediately familiar, a place we can now also call home. Anyone with psionic powers will have seen this place in their dreams, though they likely did not know it at the time.\n\nWe linger now at the precipice of this realm, not far from the empty void of the Inbetween that serves as the boundary between here and normal space - or what we would call the real world.\n\nWe find ourselves in a familiar place, encompassed by our thoughts, a confluence of all the minds that we share. In the midst of chaos we notice some disturbing shadows roaming the place, observing our every move. A spotlight sheds it's light to a giant dark mirror that stands tall right in front of us.\n\nWe must not dally... even now, we are being watched."

 psionic_shroud.3100.desc:0 "An endless desert stretches before us. We feel like we have been here before, but at the same time... we can't recognize the place.\n\nAs we take a look at the mirror our reflection fades away, it blures into multiple versions of ourselves. Past, present and future all in one.\n\nThe reflections lure us to step into the mirror, as if it were some kind of gateway.\n\n§P"Shala'kul milem zunak?"§!\n\nSomething emerges from the mirror. It is difficult to see.\n\n§P"Zharabi, melasuk."§!\n\nThe words are like thunder, spoken by a mouth for which they were never intended. We are compelled to answer."

 psionic_shroud.3110.desc:0 "An imaginary path through the nostalgically remembered past. A flower about to bloom, we smile and we cringe while all the awkward moments we once repressed come asunder and are disected before us.\n\nFrom the pieces we acquired much knowledge, the child grew strong and created a barrier arround itself to protect us from all the painfull memories, moments we rather forget... We know what we have to do, yet we don't know if we have the strength to do it."

 psionic_shroud.3111.desc:0 "A stranger adrift, shattered. Pieces sinking, flaws and virtues alike. We watch the Shroud darken as the light goes out. Knowledge brightens the night.\n\nEscape the plunging waves of these troublesome seas, leave the daily nuances behind. Perpetually defiled, we should accept what we are.\n\nIn this moment of conflict, our synaptic drones question our own very nature.\n\nWe are but moments, and thus, we are the sum of the moments we lived. We should not try to destroy the barrier, that's impossible. Instead, we should try to realize the truth... there is no barrier.\n\nAs we realize this we start to bend... our reality and what we think of ourselves changes... we feel... stronger... accepted... at peace..."

 psionic_shroud.3120.desc:0 "As our intentions are made clear, the blurriness of the mirror sharpens. The shadows through the faded dark mirror coalesce into a single figure reflecting ourselves. We can see this reflection multiplied all over the place, which begs the question: If we are everywhere, then, where are we?\n\nWe linger for a while full of curiosity.\n\nIn this place of conflict, our synaptic drones question our own very nature, and as they do so, the train of though collapses.\n\nWhat should we do?"

If so, how many parts can we remove until we are no longer... us?\n\nUnanswered questions that lead to more unanswered questions... fully aware of the nature of our existance yet unable to describe the boundries of ourselves...\n\nSuddenly an epiphany! We are an omnipresent being, we are not bound by the rules of spacetime.\n\nBy combining this knowledge and our psionic powers we could develop, in theory, a Psionic Jump Drive!"

If one knows where to look, it is even possible to glimpse into the future...\n\nOur mind has opened to the multitude of options and probabilities that exist both in the past and the future.\n\nEvery single variation and scenario, no matter how colossal or miniscule the difference between them, is being repeated inside our synaptic brains.\n\nMeditation could be key to create a stable connection to the Shroud without risking insanity."

The stench of decay is unbearable.\n\n§P"YOUR FUTURE."§!\n\nNothing living remains in the ruins. In the sky above, massive orbital installations, trailing smoke, have begun a slow and inevitable descent towards the planet. Are we witnessing one possible future out of many?\n\nThe vision ends as quickly as it began, leaving behind a strike of terrible anguish and a miasma of swirling psychic energies.\n\nTapping into the psychic energy stream is possible but the massive influx of probability data is too overwhelming to be of much practical use.\n\nA digital interface could be devised to interpret this data and be applied to improve the performance of our starships' combat computers..."

 psionic_shroud.3200.desc: "Swirling shadows, a haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which our enemies tried to impress us. The Shroud is home to many spirits and creatures, yet these shadows are alien to this realm.
