 personality_just-more-empires-expanded_fanatic_collectivists_desc:0 "On the surface, these beings appear almost nihilistic, voluntarily surrendering almost every shred of agency over their lives, even their individual genetic distinctiveness, to a hyperpowerful central authority.

 START_SCREEN_JME_DPRE:0 "§RDemocratic People's Republic of Earth§!\n\nAfter the Great War, the victorious states of the Central Powers created the Weltrat, a primitive body of representatives from all the world's countries. It utterly failed to prevent the bloodletting of the Pacific and Bosporus Wars in the latter 20th Century. The idea of a world government endured, however, but would only be able to rise again after the Feuerjahr. The Year of Fire, 1967, saw a limited exchange between the nuclear forces of the United Kingdom, German Reich, and Soviet Russia. This tragedy also caused secondary revolutions in Austro-Osmania and the United States, creating the first Neue-Demokrat governments.\n\nThe aftermath led to the founding of the Haus der Nationen. The HN was specifically chartered to prevent future nuclear calamity on Earth. Backed by the might of the Eurasian Triple Union (Austria-Hungary-Turkey) and the economic resources of America, the military alliance system underwriting the HN carried out this mission with determination. The armies of upstart powers, like Soviet France, and defunct colonialist states, like the UK, were disarmed or swept aside. All remaining nuclear weapons programs were dismantled, and Earth entered a period of unprecedented peace and growth.\n\nTechnology advanced by leaps and bounds in the earth 21st Century. Global population boomed under the watchful eye of the HN. The world came together, inspired and united by just, firm, and steady rulership. By unanimous vote of the HN General Assembly, a global People's Republic was declared, formally entering into existence on January 1, 2050. All the people of Earth now live in freedom, at least nominally so, and are protected by the strategic wisdom of the Republic General Staff and the might of the Republic Army and Space Fleet."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_DSC:0 "§RDeneb Star Corps§!\n\nThe galaxy is a dangerous, hostile place, my child, but you will learn. When our foreaunts came to this place, they brought hope with them. Their heads were in the clouds, the fools. Hope is a weakness, is it not? They paid for their weakness in blood. Our foremothers, by contrast, were grounded. Without preconception. Seeing only what was real, not dreamed. This bought them time to adapt. In war, time and space are your greatest resources, not weapons, not shields. Clear-eyed, they fought and died to win this world while others mewled and wept.\n\nNeither the cries of the weak nor the spilled lifeblood of a thousand sisters troubles the soul of a warrior. Have we not killed and been killed since the beginning of time? Each new frontier has brought new ways and new places to die. Why should the future be any different? Struggle is our heritage and our destiny. Many more untamed worlds lie beyond our star. Only those with a right mind, a flexible mind, will be able to win them. Do you understand? Not yet, but you will learn, perhaps, or perish."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_DTC:0 "§WDivine Terran Crusade§!\n\nFew may ever know what they truly were or where they came from, but the xenos came suddenly, and we were not prepared. Terra's old militaries fell within days. Our best technology was no match for them. When they didn't wipe out Mankind immediately, we were surprised, but the nukes and bio-bombs continued to rain down on those cities that did not submit. In our souls we knew that living under the yoke of this interstellar terror was not our destiny.\n\nThen, as if he were the living embodiment of our resistance, Salazar appeared among us and taught us that they could be killed. For years, we waged our insurgency and sat at the feet of the War Prophet. Salazar the Enigma became Salazar the Supreme Commander and then Salazar the Saint, teaching our forces to fight the xenos, to capture their technology, and bring its awesome power to heel to secure the destiny of Mankind. And it worked. Our ragtag bands became mighty legions and drove the invaders from Sol, never to bother Mankind again.\n\nIt has been a decade since the Blessed Liberation. The reconstruction of Terra is still ongoing and may take centuries to fully achieve. Salvaging the technology left behind by the xeno scum, we are now on our own path to the stars, a righteous path. Resolved that no future generation of Human children should ever be visited by the same fear that we have endured, the newly crowned Imperator has today declared a perpetual Divine Crusade.\n\nThe homeworld is free and safe, now and forever, but we must not rest until the terror-filled galaxy that lies beyond the hyperlane network is also secure. Our security cannot be guaranteed so long as a single xeno lives. In the holy name of Salazar, the Judicium Mortis Galactica has been issued. Our fleets shall multiply and the relics of our martyrs fill a million temples until the day that only the children of Terra remain. Deus vult!"
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_ECA:0 "§BEarth Colonial Administration§!\n\nBuilding a diverse planetary civilization was the easy part. Keeping it together was the challenge. A witch's brew of advances in automation, anthropogenic climate change, and overpopulation created the conditions for catastrophic conflict between Earth's nation-states in the 21st Century. There were more and more of us, and everyone wanted their share of a smaller and smaller pile of resources. The world seemed near a point of no return, but thankfully, cooler heads prevailed. The voices of science, peace, and prosperity were loud enough to drown out the cries of bigots and warmongers. In our darkest hours, we came together.\n\nWith careful planning and prudent policies, the United Nations weathered its perilous infancy and the fitful twilight of hegemonic nation-states to mature into a global government ensuring liberty for all Humanity. Then, early in the 22nd Century, our deep space telescopes detected faint signatures of civilization elsewhere in the galaxy. This humbled us and inspired wonder. We were not alone. But who was out there? Riven with petty rivalries and hatreds, our ancestors were not ready to reach into the cosmos, but we are. Secure in this knowledge, we look outward. Whatever other life may be, we are from Earth, and we come in peace."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_HSTHC:0 "§RHoly See of Terra and Her Colonies§!\n\nThe empire of Rome has stood the test of time. In her darkest hour, the Empire was restored to glory by the Emperor Justinian the Great and the Invincible General Belisarius. Inspired and empowered by their reconquests, Rome withstood its enemies for centuries. Grim though the wars with Persia, Islam, India, and distant China were, God was always on the side of the Legions. More blessed still were Rome's philosophers. In 1798, they achieved powered flight. In 1911, the first Imperial astronaut set foot upon Luna.\n\nAlthough nominally ruled by the Emperor, who is selected from among the royal bloodlines, the real power on Terra rests with the Church. Non-royal but possessed of enormous assets, the great elector bishops each command millions of personal subjets. While they often bicker and compete amongst themselves, it is their august council and the word of the Pontifex Maximus which sets Imperial policy. The Church has led the slow inevitable march into space, carving up the Solar System. Yet God wills that Humanity is to stand astride the entire galaxy. Now FTL-capable, we will gather the Legions and carry the Aquila to the farthest shores imaginable. Roma Invicta!"
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_LNSI:0 "§WLiao-Nishanti Stellar Industries§!\n\nThe Board has shown it has the stomach for playing the long game. The fact that we are here at all is proof enough of that. An entire civilization built from the ground up out of whole cloth on a virgin world far away from Earth and the yellow-white light of Sol...\n\nThe discovery in the late 21st Century of that strange, unexplained wormhole on the edge of the old home system instantly doubled the habitable space available to Humanity and opened a new frontier on an unprecedented scale.\n\nBut only the Company had the organizational capacity to do anything about it. Looking at the first new source of energy in generations, the Board remembered that he who controls the sources of energy controls the means of survival. Crossing the threshold spanning the galaxy, we bathed in the blue light of Deneb and set about bringing it to heel.\n\nThere was no gradual evolution from previous systems here. The Company poured resources through the wormhole until we materialized, almost simultaneously, every independent piece of this economy on the surface of Pyrrho. Sensing the decay of Earth's fortunes, a used up world in a used up system, the Board then boldly dedicated our entire enterprise to the new world. Colonization became exodus.\n\nIt is a fundamental reality of this universe that resources are limited. It is a fundamental policy of this Company that resources exist to be consumed. And consumed they will be, if not by this generation then by some future. By what right does this forgotten future seek to deny us our birthright? Let us take what is ours, chew and eat our fill."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_MID:0 "§WMirandan Interstellar Directorate§!\n\nWhen the UNSS Ulysses left Earth, over 100 years ago, our ancestors still had no idea how far they would have to go to find a new home. They crossed countless lightyears, an incomprehensible distance bridged by a natural wormhole that science has still yet to explain, to discover Miranda. This brilliant blue moon is so much like Earth, but not exactly. It would take some work. So too would we.\n\nIn order to build a home here, bold leadership was needed. Our ancestors would have to cross barriers in our own genetic code almost as vast as the interstellar gulf between Sol and our new star, Deneb. Thankfully, the early colonial administrators, our Founders, were inspired by a daring vision of the future. They set about engineering Miranda and also to engineering us.\n\nTwo lines were born, like the intertwined rails of the double helix, one built for erudition and another for the noble life of crude labor. The result of this great work was the Mirandan Miracle. The Founders designed preternatural vigor into our genetic fabric, fueling a rapid Mirandan cloning program as well as efficient polyzygotic reproduction among our Caliban kin. Our numbers ballooned and we colonized a planetary body the equal of Earth in a single century.\n\nIn the process, we birthed a new kind of society, one perfectly adapted to its environment. Without a doubt we remain in touch with our Humanity, but we are not like the Humans who boarded the great ark all those years ago. We are more Human than Human. We are Mirandans, and the stars too will soon be ours."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_OAC:0 "§WOrder of Azrael's Chosen§!\n\nThose who merely spoke the names of the Divine did not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. As our forebears approached the shimmering Gate, the archangel Azrael looked down upon them and saw those who would do the works of God, those who would cast out demons in His name. The rest, workers of lawlessness, were made to depart from His sight. The Chosen few were brought into the light and given quarter on Heaven's golden shores in the blessed garden of New Eden.\n\nWe are the heirs of their pious sojourn. Though few at first, our numbers have grown as we drank the honeyed waters and tasted the sweet fruit of our empyrean sanctuary. No finer a world than this could our ancestors have imagined as they writhed in the squallor of Earth.\n\nThe old world was always meant to serve as a spiritual battlefield, and its many scars are testament to that service. Sin sullied the Earth as it did much of the universe. In time it, like so many other imperfect worlds, will be nothing more than a dead and forgotten mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\n\nThe future, and indeed the past, lies in our hands. Azrael, whose word is a lamp for our feet and a light on our path, has revealed to us the purpose of our separation from Earth and our elevation in the house of God. We are the avenging angels, Azrael's Chosen, born to do battle with Hell's demons. From the sanctuary of Heaven we will begin the final war for the liberation of all creation.\n\nThis is an awesome charge! And it is one that only our great grandchildren, or some yet further generation, will see brought to completion. Yet when that day comes, light will shine into the darkness and the darkness will not overcome it. God will look once more upon His work and see that it is good."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_PHE:0 "§WPresidium of Human Enlightenment§!\n\nCivilization nearly ran away with itself. Earth's population swelled past 10 billion by the middle of the 21st Century, and it could not be sustained. We faced a choice either to die or to transform. We transformed. The teachings of the great sage Yang showed us the path to enlightenment.\n\nHumanity learned to overcome the crass demands of flesh and bone, for they warped the matrix through which we perceived the world. Remember, enlightenment is a function of willpower, not of physical strength.\n\nIf our society seems more nihilistic than that of previous eras, perhaps this is simply a sign of our maturity as a sentient species. We no longer hold to myth and fairy tales, especially the myth of self. Pain, even agony, is no more than information before the senses, data fed to the computer of the mind.\n\nThe lesson is simple: you have received the information, now act on it. Take control of the input and you shall become master of the output. But do not linger overlong. Once enlightened, you are ready for transmutation. It is every citizen's final duty to go into the tanks and become one with all the people."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_RUS:0 "§RRevolutionary Union of Sol§!\n\nThe forces of socialism, fascism, and capitalism struggled for supremacy for far too long, delaying Humanity's ascent and leaving entire generations in the dust. Millions of people died in the wars of the 20th and 21st centuries. Only through incredible restraint were the leaders of that era able to hold mankind back from the brink of total annihilation. Ideological struggle played itself out, and in the end the people prevailed.\n\nMarxist-Leninist-Maoism reached Luna in 1971 with the historic manned landing of Alexei Leonov. The revolution reached Mars in 2022. Gagarin Base, our first deep space outpost, became operational at the L3 point in 2047. The conquest of space, like the conquest of the atom, was natural to the progress of Humanity as a species, just as the advent of communism was natural to the progress of our politics.\n\nMoscow won the Cold War, but it was on the other side of the planet that the Ford Island Accord was signed in 2087, establishing the Revolutionary Union of Earth (later Sol). In the Union, science and technology serve a central role in politics, culture, and individual identity. Regional and continental soviets, whose management techniques have been refined by centuries of practice, oversee economic systems to the maximum benefit of the working class.\n\nA life of honest labor is still highly prized, but the call for explorers and pioneers is rising. Some state scholars claim our society is entering a post-communist era during which resource abundance and the near infinite frontiers of deep space will evolve our civilization into something even more just and free. Now that we have at last unlocked the secrets of FTL travel, the stars too will soon be red."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_SCE:0 "§GSacred Commonwealth of Earth§!\n\nTwo Great Tribulations shaped Human history on Earth more than any others: the Plague and the War. The generations that came after each were so changed from those that had lived before as to constitute almost entirely different civilizations. Awoken to emptiness in the aftermath of the Plague, the reinvigorated peoples of Andalus and Anatolia surged forth with hope and vitality. Much later, as the poison gas of the Long War finally cleared, the eastern promises of Jinshan and Japan were reborn.\n\nConsidered over a long enough time span, these tremendous losses brought comensurate gain. They also taught lessons that we ignore now at our peril. We like to think that the Hodenosaunee Intervention and the example of the Alpine Emirates or the Isfahan Conference demonstrated our progress as a species, but without continuous effort, chaos still lies little more than a few weeks away. So, to safeguard the planet--and the species--we built the Commonwealth. Sensitive to nature and to the needs of all the peoples of Earth, our sacred union may just avoid a Third Tribulation.\n\nWith the realization that faster-than-light travel is possible by navigating the hyperlanes of subspace, we now turn our attentions to the vast galaxy beyond the Solar System. Gazing starward, we rely on leaders who hear an enlightened voice telling them, 'God prostrates whatever creature is in the heavens and whatever is on the Earth, and also the angels, and they are not arrogant.' Humanity will follow its own course, but one of moderation, as it rises to join what is hopefully a tapestry of likeminded species spanning the heavens."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_TM:0 "§PTellusian Mindflower§!\n\nApparently, sir, the fungus has been the dominant lifeform on the planet since about the time of the Lower Paleozoic on Earth. But it has been locked in a tragic cycle. Every hundred million years or so it achieves the critical mass necessary to become sentient, but the final metamorphosis kills off most of the other life on the planet. Lacking food sources and the maintenance its animal symbiotes provided, the fungus could maintain only a brief season of godhood before dying back into the 'flower dream' for another hundred million years. It always achieved its godlike intelligence just exactly too late to do anything to prevent the dieback. After the dieback only vague memories and rudimentary intelligence remained, and the cycle continued.\n\n§WUntil we arrived.§!\n\nPrecisely. For the first time, the cycle may be broken.\n\n§WIs it possible to prevent the dieback? And can we survive in any recognizable form if Tellus flowers to godhood?§!\n\nI believe it is possible. It involves a process that will change both us and Tellus forever. The majority of the survivors will upload their personalities directly into the Mind.\n\n§WWe will have to give up our bodies, our humanity?§!\n\nThose who wish to live out their lives in their original human form will be allowed to do so, since the deeper fungal roots can preserve genetic material through the metamorphosis. But many of us are eager to accept Tellus' gift and join the dawning superintelligence. That's where the catch comes in. It is likely that only a few of us will be able to join the dominant personality, to transcend our humanity entirely and reach a truly higher plane of existence. We must move quickly or all may be lost.\n\n§WWe have already lost so much... Well, what are we waiting for?§!"

 START_SCREEN_JME_TMC:0 "§HTerran Millennium Covenant§!\n\nWorld War III was waged in an afternoon, and the Covenant was born the following morning. Mankind survived Armageddon, although just barely, by the grace of God. In its aftermath, the survivors experienced religious revivals. Old orders turned over. New philosophies captured the hearts of the people. All the world united in the same suffering, and the great faiths drifted together. Under the blanket of a nuclear winter, leaders of Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Bahai, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Daoist, and Confucian communities forged the Millennium Covenant.\n\nThe Covenant is a pact of peace and brotherhood to last one thousand years. Its Guardian Council is so influential that it is the de facto government of Earth although nation-states still nominally exist. Swearing to prevent the mistakes of the past, the Guardian Council directs how technology is to be used and how economies should function. With FTL travel at last proven feasible, the Council now undertakes the great work of finding habitable worlds beyond the spoiled Old Earth, the Garden of Eden out of which we have been cast for our fathomless sins."

 START_SCREEN_JME_UEF:0 "§BUnited Earth Federation§!\n\nUnlimited democracy was a failure. In the 21st Century, the pre-scientific pseudo-professional class, the so-called social scientists, brought our world to the brink of total chaos. This was the time of the Disorders, a time of violence and horror such as Earth had never known before, culminating in the Third World War. The veterans of that era organized and took control, imposing vigilante law and order first in Europe and then across all of Earth.\n\nThe remaining national governments went defunct one by one as their people saw the contrast between the corrupt ways of the past and the moral certainty of the young veteran-led contingency authorities. In time, this new system brought about the stability that has lasted for generations since.\n\nThus was born the Federation. Our limited democratic system recognizes that something given, even if it is the right to vote, has no value. There is value only in something earned. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, defending it with their life, and thus earns the right to vote. A civilian does not.\n\nThis is how violence is controlled, harnessed, to build rather than destroy our society. When a citizen votes, he or she is exercising political authority, using force. Using violence. And violence is the supreme authority from which all other authority is derived. Naked force has resolved more issues throughout history than any other factor, but it must be channeled in order to be meaningful. People who forget that have always paid a steep price. The future will be no different."
 
 START_SCREEN_JME_USR:0 "§BUnited Systems Republic§!\n\nHumanity's destiny seemed very much in doubt during the last 400 years. Technology outpaced our cultural development and placed in the hands of short-sighted madmen the tools for unraveling all life on our homeworld. Data wars, resource wars, and wars over who did or did not qualify as fully Human played out in sequel after sequel.\n\nAlthough actual battlefield deaths declined as technology improved, our hopes of surviving this cycle of violence steadily declined. Near the end came the Dark Information Age, when it was almost impossible to tell fact from fantasy, to say nothing of finding a glass of clean drinking water. We grew up as a species almost too late. The industrial wastelands and remaining impoverished regions of Earth are our inheritance from those years when civilization teetered on the edge.\n\nThe first convention of the UN Parliament in 2061 was the firebreak from which we waged the campaign to reclaim our future. This desperate final gasp of principled leadership, backed by a few youthful world powers, managed to last just long enough. We held the line. Science and industry began to move off-world. One by one, societies turned forward, finding peace and reconciliation staring them in the face.\n\nThe signing of the Articles of Republic on Ford Island in 2172 represent the culmination of centuries of visionary work, often fiercely opposed, to bring Humanity together. With the exception of some far-flung interstellar colonies and unincorporated frontier outposts, that unity is now real. The United Systems is a single federalized state entrusted with the fortunes of Earth and all her children."
