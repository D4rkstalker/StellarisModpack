But that is your problem, not ours. Please remember that, because we give no refunds or are responsible for tracking where the gold is located after the planets completion.

We could however offer you a suitable replacement: we can put a special type of aphrodisiac into the atmosphere.

Our empire had everything it needed... but its citizens lacked purpose. Let's just say that living in a postscarcety society becomes very, very boring after a while. Almost everything has already been discovered, you don't have to work, don't have to fight, all you do is procrastinate. Life in luxury is great and all, but without purpose, there really is not much to live for. For our species at least. Some fall into degeneracy, some become careless adventureseekers, some freak out and become mad, some simply give up. Most empires fall under that societal pressure. We were a small faction of that empire that tried to combat that decay, find some purpose to get us out of this maddening situation. And we found it in our art of designing planets and running an intergalactic buisness. We limit the amount of resources we create for ourselfs, force ourselfs to use money and live by strict rules. I have no idea how our home galaxy looks like right now and we do not want to know. Anyway, lets get back to designing absurd, dumb planets, shall we?"
planet_builders.move_station:0 "Can you relocate your base?"
planet_builders.155.desc:0 "Relocate our base? Well, if you really want to. Just enact a decision on any planet and we will move there right away, no questions asked! It is going to cost some money though."
planet_builders.155.a:0 "Ugh, fine. Have your money."
planet_builders.106.desc:0 "Great! I knew our projections were right. Anyway, let me tell you how this will go: Building a planet takes time and a LOT of money. Because of this, the process is made up into multiple stages. Each time we reach a new stage we will contact you again and ask for your input on how you want the planet to be like. And for payment, of course. The first step is to decide where to put it. For that we will give you a holographic-projector ship for 500£energy£. Fly the ship where you want your planet to be, then disband the fleet it is in (the fleet, NOT the ship). This will place a hologram of the planet, for planning purposes. Through a decision on the planet you can start the building process for another 4500£energy£. After that, you will decide on the planets size, class, modifiers and if there should be any primitives living on it. And pay according  to your wishes, of course."
planet_builders.106.buy.response:0 "Good. The ship should appear in your capitals orbit... right about now."
planet_builders.106.buy:0 "We accept."
planet_builders.107.desc:0 "Of course, contact us again when ever you have the money."
planet_builders.107.a:0 "sure thing."
planet_builders.109.desc:0 "Lost the ship, ey? Well, we have a bunch of these things, so take another one. 700£energy£ please! And remember to disband the FLEET not the ship."
planet_builders.109.a:0 "fine. here is the money."
planet_builders.109.b:0 "Wait, wasn't it 500£energy£ the last time?"
planet_builders.109.response:0 "Well, all the extra time it takes to get a new ship, teleport it to your destination, filling out the paperwork, configuring the projector and many other costly steps, take a lot more than 500£energy£. Normaly that is covered by the customers later paments to build the planet, but since you lot your projector ship somehow, we got to make up the cost in another way. You can pay or choose to not build a planet just because of measly 700£energy£. Your decision."

According to our scans it is one of the largest specimens of its species we have ever encountered and it looks rather...hungry. If we do not do anything soon, this will become a disaster for the population on [this.GetName]. It will literaly start EATING the planet!"
