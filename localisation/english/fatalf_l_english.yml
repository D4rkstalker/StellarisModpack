 fatalf.001.desc_a: "The [Root.GetName] reports that their sensors detected a strange energy signature moments before they had collided with a small entity. Closer inspection reveals that it was a probe of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] make and was transmitting the first 112 digits of pi on repeat. It is only scrap now."
 fatalf.001.desc_b: "The [Root.GetName] reports that their sensors detected a strange energy signature moments before they had collided with a small entity. Closer inspection revealed that it was a probe of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] make and was transmitting popular [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] song. It is only scrap now."
 fatalf.001.desc_c: "The [Root.GetName] reports that their sensors detected a strange energy signature moments before they had collided with a small entity.

 fatalf.001.desc_d: "The [Root.GetName] reports that their sensors detected a strange energy signature moments before they had collided with a small entity.

 fatalf.001.name: "A Strange Probe"
 fatalf.003.desc: "Familiar energy spikes were captured near [Root.GetName]. We feared the worst, but obviously there are several tons of packaged meat belonging to an unknown avian organism. By all accounts, it is safely edible."
 fatalf.003.title: "Frozen Food"
 fatalf.004.desc: "Our planetary sensors are picking extremely high radiation readings in low orbit of [Root.GetName]. It has a similar energy signal to previous unexplained phenomenon.

 fatalf.004.title: "Misplaced Bomb"
 fatalf.005.desc: "A small asteroid appears in orbit of [Root.GetName]. It was unknown and undetected until moments ago, when we discovered it, along with a familiar energy signal. While it is too small to be of any danger, it may provide a large quantity of minerals."
 fatalf.005.title: "Extradimensional Asteroid"
 fatalf.006.desc: "A series of large, constant energy pulses with an unknown cause weaken the magnetic field of [Root.GetName]. While it isn't deadly, it does make daily life quite uncomfortable."
 fatalf.006.title: "Electromagnetic Pulse"
 fatalf.007.desc: "A small portal has opened up in the sky above [Root.GetName]. Though we cannot see through it, it does provide some interesting data, much like the destroyed probe, allowing for useful study."
 fatalf.007.title: "Strange Readings"
 fatalf.008.desc: "We detect large energy signatures in low orbit of [Root.GetName]. Almost immediately, lighting strikes all across the planet, vaporizing numerous civilians. Was this caused by the same effect that brought us the strange probe?"
 fatalf.008.title: "Rapid Energy Strikes"
 fatalf.009.desc: "Simultaneously, every sensor in our empire detects an extremely large energy anomaly located just above our capital. Our sensors are giving the same readings as those found from the destroyed probe. Just as quickly as it appeared, it dissipates with no visible effect."
 fatalf.009.title: "Nothing?"
 fatalf.010.desc: "As our ships get closer for research, you can see the small tear floating in space. Examination tells you that it has now stabilized enough in orbit that you could send a small probe through, and by having it give off a pulse of a specific energy blast, you could close it permanently. You could also have it transmit audio, on the chance someone finds it."
 fatalf.011.desc: "Surprisingly, as our probe goes through the tear, a small wormhole opens up for a short period of time. By watching how it affects the travel and transmission of our probe, we could use this knowledge to learn the secrets of these bypasses."
 fatalf.011.title: "Stabilization"
 fatalf.012.desc: "Our probe travels through the tear and sends out its pulse, just as planned. Moments later, all communication is lost as the tear seals itself. We won't have to worry about this anymore."
 fatalf.012.title: "Gone Long Gone"
 fatalf.020.desc: "While surveying [From.From.GetName], our science ship discovers a large iron tablet floating in orbit. Engraved on it are directions to two planets across the galaxy, and a series of pictograms showing various energy convergences onto each. The purpose of these convergences are unknown, as they do not resemble any known scientific phenomenon."
 fatalf.020.title: "Ancient Directions"
 fatalf.022.desc: "As our colonists set foot on the planet and begin to spread, they receive reports of what is described as a multitude of 'floating windows' in the sky over [Root.GetName]. Though there are currently many, some are slowly disappearing."
 fatalf.022.title: "The Floating Windows"
 fatalf.023.desc: "As our scientists move to investigate, they send reports that these windows are in fact glimpses into other, alternate worlds. Even more interestingly, our population on [Root.GetName] says that they each are having strange dreams, and they ask for only one thing. Our greatest desire."
