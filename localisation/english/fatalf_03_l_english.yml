Openings in the wall reveal small machines that would fire high-powered rounds at whoever is on the track.\nThe track ends in an enormous metal door with six levers on it, where the only way through is to pull on each simultaneously with immense force.\nWithin the next room is another tablet - §MTEST MIND§!."

  fatalf_site.002.desc:0 "Further exploration reveals a twisting labyrinth whose walls constantly shift when out of sight, and the hallways within barely large enough for two people to stand together.\nOn occasion, these walls glow in rapid, seemingly random patterns. Eventually, your scientist discovers that the patterns relate to the labyrinth in a fourth-dimensional representation, and uses their computers to find a path through.\nThey also discover a set of numerous heating units, seemingly designed to raise the temperature of the labyrinth to rapidly unbearable temperatures.\nWith an exit, all that remains is a tablet reading - §MTEST MOBRUP§!.\nWhat could that mean?"

  fatalf_site.003.desc:0 "Whatever the test of 'Mobrup' is meant to be, it doesn't appear to do anything, as your scientists continue forward with no further interruptions. Now hundrends of miles below ground, they find a great network of computers. Though most of the data has long since been hopelessly corrupted by the flow of time, there still remains some information about a very peculiar species with immense strength, speed, and intelligence who travelled to this place as a final test. Whatever happened to the rest of them, we may never know.\nThere also sits one last tablet, all of which who see it only read - §MNO§!."

  fatalf_site_competition_desc:0 "A great building, which our scanners reveal to extend hundreds of miles into the ground, has been discovered on [From.Planet.GetName]. The only clue as to the purpose is a tablet on the outside.\nIt is in no language we recognize, yet curiously, all who see it can understand it's meaning - §MTEST BODY§!."
