# TECH STUFF
################################################################################################################################################

tech_pd_destroyer_1: "PD Destroyer Upgrade"
tech_pd_destroyer_1_desc: "Missiles, torpedoes, and strike craft all pose a grave threat to our fleets. Our naval engineers suggest re-designing our Destroyers to mount an array of numerous point-defense weapons to shoot down these targets before they can reach our ships."

tech_StrikeCruiser_1: "Strike Cruiser"
tech_StrikeCruiser_1_desc: "Battle experience and extensive wargaming exercises show that fleet combat often ends without a decisive outcome, because the losing side makes an immediate, emergency jump to FTL. Our best scientists have miniaturized the Subspace Snare used on starbases for deployment onto a ship. These vessels will be blisteringly fast, to catch enemy fleets in their Snares, maneuverable enough to keep enemy ships from disengaging from combat, and tough enough to withstand significant punishment to ensure the enemy is pinned down for as long as possible."

tech_Battlecruiser_1: "Battlecruiser"
tech_Battlecruiser_1_desc: "As larger and larger vessels become more common, combat is taking place at longer ranges, and offensive firepower is becoming an ever-more-decisive factor in battle. Our naval theorists suggest building a long, powerful vessel capable of mounting large, medium, and most notably, guided weapon emplacements, to specialize in hurling as much weaponry at the enemy as possible, in either mid- or long-range combat."

tech_escortcarrier_1: "Escort Carrier"
tech_escortcarrier_1_desc: "Planetary combat has long included an aerial component, with fighter and bomber planes proving absolutely essential to any armed conflict. Using section models based on the highly successful Cruiser design, we can now build warships large enough to launch a space-based variant of these powerful war machines."

tech_Carrier_1: "Carrier"
tech_Carrier_1_desc: "Strike Craft have proven to be highly successful weapons in naval combat. It is time to design a specialized warship for the express purpose of carrying these weapons into battle, and housing the large support staff and maintenance bays that they require. Doing so will allow these new Carrier vessels to carry far more strike craft than their more improvised predecessors."

tech_heavycarrier_1: "Heavy Carrier Upgrade"
tech_heavycarrier_1_desc: "As our ship building capabilities continue to increase, we continue to look for new ways to advance our current ship class layouts. Combined with new advancements in miniaturizing many of the support facilities required for the maintenance of strike craft, we believe that we can alter our existing Carrier designs into Heavy Carriers, with the ability to support more hangar bays."

tech_supercarrier_1: "Supercarrier Upgrade"
tech_supercarrier_1_desc: "Further efforts in both ship construction and miniaturization of strike craft support facilities will allow us to squeeze an absolutely incredible number of hangar bays into our Carriers. These Supercarriers will be able to support swarms of strike craft, the better to defend our fleets from attack, and to overwhelm the foe with our best pilots."

tech_spitfire_1: "Spitfire Battleship Specialization"
tech_spitfire_1_desc: "While capital ships are far more powerful than any vessels that have come before them, they are also far more expensive, and pose juicy targets for swarms of smaller, cheaper vessels that can overwhelm the capital ships with sheer numbers. To counter this, our engineers are working on a few blueprints that could adapt the Battleship into an anti-Corvette-and-Destroyer powerhouse, along with weapons specifically designed for that purpose. These new designs will cause these 'Spitfire Battleships' to have an even higher production cost, but such sacrifices are worth it, if it means protecting our vulnerable capital ships."

tech_Dreadnought_1: "Dreadnought"
tech_Dreadnought_1_desc: "The Battleship heralded a new era of ship design and naval combat. The ability to both deliver and take massive damage at long range, and the advent of devastating XL weaponry, have completely changed the nature of warfare. Our naval engineers believe that we should develop an even better version of these powerful ships. Their proposed 'Dreadnoughts' would be capable of mounting heavier defenses, more guns, and even two of the incredible XL weapons that have been so successful on the battlefield."

tech_Flagship_1: "The Flagship"
tech_Flagship_1_desc: "The naval arms race has seen the production of larger and larger warships with no end in sight. Our naval engineers have suggested jumping to the logical conclusion of this serial escalation by constructing a ship so massive and powerful, that no empire will be able to support more than one of them at a time. This proposed Flagship will be the ultimate warship. Designed for maximum versatility, each section will have many possible configurations, allowing us to design our Flagship to suit our purposes. Mounting far more thrusters per ton than any other ship, the Flagship will be able to take any position in the fleet, from a long-range battery in the rear, to a massive brawler at the tip of a fleet's spear.\n\nThis power and versatility will come at a heavy cost, however. Merely building the Flagship will be an enormous endeavor, requiring a colossal stockpile of resources and a significant investment of time and manpower. Upon completion, it will take the entire GDP of a small star nation to maintain; as a result, it will require a massive amount of political influence to obtain approval for the project."

tech_supportcruiser_1: "Support Cruiser Upgrade"
tech_supportcruiser_1_desc: "As our fleets grow in size, and the distance they travel from home increases, it becomes necessary to support them internally instead of trying to maintain long-range supply lines. The Support Cruiser is the answer to this problem, adding new support capabilities to our Cruisers through the addition of advanced modules." 

tech_explorationship_1: "Exploration Cruiser (Level 1)"
tech_explorationship_1_desc: "Our intrepid Science Officers have faced incredible danger in their quest to explore the galaxy and uncover all the secrets it has to offer. Our naval engineers suggest the development of a large, combat-capable Science Ship dedicated to exploring new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations, and boldly going where no one has gone before."

tech_explorationship_2: "Exploration Cruiser (Level 2)"
tech_explorationship_2_desc: "Our intrepid Science Officers have faced incredible danger in their quest to explore the galaxy and uncover all the secrets it has to offer. Our naval engineers, pleased with the performance of the Exploration Cruiser, suggest developing a more powerful variant to further increase the protection available to our best and brightest Science Officers."

tech_explorationship_3: "Exploration Cruiser (Level 3)"
tech_explorationship_3_desc: "Our intrepid Science Officers have faced incredible danger in their quest to explore the galaxy and uncover all the secrets it has to offer. Our naval engineers, pleased with the performance of the Exploration Cruiser's upgraded form, suggest developing an even more powerful variant to further increase the protection available to our best and brightest Science Officers."

tech_starbase_6: "Grand Citadel Starbase"
tech_starbase_6_desc: "As fleets grow larger and more powerful, it becomes necessary for our starbases and defensive installations to grow in strength, as well. The Grand Citadel is a powerful and highly advanced system defense station, a massive upgrade to existing Citadel-class starbases. These valuable and highly developed starbases are important installations to our empire, and can support a wide range of facilities."

tech_starbase_7: "Solar Stronghold Starbase"
tech_starbase_7_desc: "The final upgrade in the starbase chain, the Solar Stronghold is the ultimate command and defense station, the largest class of starbase that it is possible to build. Enemy fleets will break upon these massive bulwarks, and each one is a vital asset to our empire, defending the most critical locations on the galactic map."

tech_space_defense_station_2: "Deep Space Defenses 2"
tech_space_defense_station_2_desc: "As fleets grow larger and more powerful, it becomes necessary for our defensive installations to grow in strength, as well.

Our naval engineers suggest re-designing our Destroyers to mount an array of numerous point-defense weapons to shoot down these targets before they can reach our ships."

TECH_UNLOCK_STRIKECRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Ship Type:§! Strike Cruiser"
TECH_UNLOCK_STRIKECRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_DESC: "§HStrike Cruiser§!\nBattle experience and extensive wargaming exercises show that fleet combat often ends without a decisive outcome, because the losing side makes an immediate, emergency jump to FTL. Our best scientists have miniaturized the Subspace Snare used on starbases for deployment onto a ship. These vessels will be blisteringly fast, to catch enemy fleets in their Snares, maneuverable enough to keep enemy ships from disengaging from combat, and tough enough to withstand significant punishment to ensure the enemy is pinned down for as long as possible."

TECH_UNLOCK_BATTLECRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Ship Type:§! Battlecruiser"
TECH_UNLOCK_BATTLECRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_DESC: "§HBattlecruiser§!\nAs larger and larger vessels become more common, combat is taking place at longer ranges, and offensive firepower is becoming an ever-more-decisive factor in battle.

TECH_UNLOCK_SPITFIRE_CONSTRUCTION_TITLE: "§HSpitfire Battleship Upgrade§!"
TECH_UNLOCK_SPITFIRE_CONSTRUCTION_DESC: "While capital ships are far more powerful than any vessels that have come before them, they are also far more expensive, and pose juicy targets for swarms of smaller, cheaper vessels that can overwhelm the capital ships with sheer numbers. To counter this, our engineers are working on a few blueprints that could adapt the Battleship into an anti-Corvette-and-Destroyer powerhouse, along with weapons specifically designed for that purpose. These new designs will cause these 'Spitfire Battleships' to have an even higher production cost, but such sacrifices are worth it, if it means protecting our vulnerable capital ships."

TECH_UNLOCK_DREADNOUGHT_CONSTRUCTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Ship Type:§! Dreadnought"
TECH_UNLOCK_DREADNOUGHT_CONSTRUCTION_DESC: "§HDreadnought§!\nThe Battleship heralded a new era of ship design and naval combat. The ability to both deliver and take massive damage at long range, and the advent of devastating XL weaponry, have completely changed the nature of warfare. Our naval engineers believe that we should develop an even better version of these powerful ships. Their proposed "Dreadnoughts" would be capable of mounting heavier defenses, more guns, and even two of the incredible XL weapons that have been so successful on the battlefield."

TECH_UNLOCK_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Ship Type:§! Flagship"
TECH_UNLOCK_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_DESC: "§HFlagship§!\nThe naval arms race has seen the production of larger and larger warships with no end in sight. Our naval engineers have suggested jumping to the logical conclusion of this serial escalation by constructing a ship so massive and powerful, that no empire will be able to support more than one of them at a time. This proposed Flagship will be the ultimate warship. Designed for maximum versatility, each section will have many possible configurations, allowing us to design our Flagship to suit our purposes. Mounting far more thrusters per ton than any other ship, the Flagship will be able to take any position in the fleet, from a long-range battery in the rear, to a massive brawler at the tip of a fleet's spear.\n\nThis power and versatility will come at a heavy cost, however. Merely building the Flagship will be an enormous endeavor, requiring a colossal stockpile of resources and a significant investment of time and manpower. Upon completion, it will take the entire GDP of a small star nation to maintain; as a result, it will require a massive amount of political influence to obtain approval for the project."

TECH_UNLOCK_SUPPORTSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Ship Upgrade:§! Support Cruiser"
TECH_UNLOCK_SUPPORTSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_DESC: "§HFleet Support Ship§!\nAs our fleets grow in size, and the distance they travel from home increases, it becomes necessary to support them internally instead of trying to maintain long-range supply lines.

################################################################################################################################################

policy_armament_doctrine: "Armament Doctrine"
policy_armament_doctrine_desc: "This Fleet Doctrine determines what armaments our ship designs should emphasize, at the expense of reduced efficiency with other weapons."

balanced_focus_name: "Standard Armament"
balanced_focus: "Standard Armament"
balanced_focus_desc: "We will spread our focus evenly across the weapon types; there is no need to specialize in one to the detriment of the others."

kinetic_focus_name: "Kinetic Focus"
kinetic_focus: "Kinetic Focus"
kinetic_focus_desc: "Kinetic weapons have a long and storied history. Our Kinetic weapons will tear through enemy shields and hulls and bring glory to our nation."

energy_focus_name: "Energy Focus"
energy_focus: "Energy Focus"
energy_focus_desc: "There is a certain majesty to the manipulation of direct energy to destroy one's foes. Our Energy weapons will burn through enemy ships and melt away their fleets."

guided_munitions_focus_name: "Explosive / Strike Craft Focus"
guided_munitions_focus: "Explosive / Strike Craft Focus"
guided_munitions_focus_desc: "Explosive weapons and Strike Craft go hand-in-hand. Our powerful missiles and valiant pilots will secure victory for our people."

policy_defense_doctrine: "Defense Doctrine"
policy_defense_doctrine_desc: "TThis Fleet Doctrine determines which type of ship defenses our ships should emphasize, at the cost of reduced efficiency with the other defensive option."

uniform_focus_name: "Standard Defenses"
uniform_focus: "Standard Defenses"
uniform_focus_desc: "We will focus on armor and shields in equal measure; there is no need to favor one over the other. They are strongest together."

armor_focus_name: "Armor Focus"
armor_focus: "Armor Focus"
armor_focus_desc: "Trust in the strength of our Armor. Thick and impenetrable, it surrounds our hulls in its protective embrace, and cannot be ignored by missiles or torpedoes."

shield_focus_name: "Shield Focus"
shield_focus: "Shield Focus"
shield_focus_desc: "Shimmering shields are the superior defensive option. Unlike armor, they recharge without the need for repairs, allowing for extended campaigns without the need to halt our pace of operations."

policy_composition_doctrine: "Fleet Composition Doctrine"
policy_composition_doctrine_desc: "This Fleet Doctrine determines which types of ships should make up the bulk of our naval forces, allowing us to construct our favored vessels more quickly at a lower cost, at the expense of taking longer and costing more to build ships that we are not emphasizing."

standard_composition_name: "Standard Composition"
standard_composition: "Standard Composition"
standard_composition_desc: "Every ship has its place; we should not retool our shipyards to favor one type of construction over another. A wide-ranging fleet is the best option."

light_ship_focus_name: "Light Ship Focus"
light_ship_focus: "Light Ship Focus"
light_ship_focus_desc: "Light ships are cheap and speedy, both in construction and in space. They're perfect for quashing pirates, protecting trade, defending wide swathes of space, screening larger vessels, and defending our nation on a budget. We need to prioritize the construction of these valuable vessels."

versatility_focus_name: "Cruiser Focus"
versatility_focus: "Cruiser Focus"
versatility_focus_desc: "Cruisers, and their larger cousins, Strike Cruisers and Battlecruisers, are the most versatile ships we can build. They excel at all ranges, with a wide range of weapons, and are tough enough to withstand a hit, but don't take nearly as long to build, or cost nearly as much to produce and maintain, as capital ships. For a versatile fleet, we should focus on Cruisers to fill out our Navy."

capital_focus_name: "Capital Ship Focus"
capital_focus: "Capital Ship Focus"
capital_focus_desc: "Capital Ships are the pride of our fleets. With heavy armaments to obliterate the enemy, and heavy defenses to shrug off any attack, these mighty warships are the greatest weapon in our arsenal. They are nothing less than the future of galactic warfare, and we should build our fleets around them, and focus our efforts on their construction."

carrier_focus_name: "Carrier Focus"
carrier_focus: "Carrier Focus"
carrier_focus_desc: "Our Strike Craft are our greatest weapons. Our pilots are the best and brightest of our people, and our Carriers are the vessels that deploy our valiant warriors into battle. And when the time comes to invade enemy words, our Carriers can even carry ground troops with them to capture entire planets. We must focus our efforts on producing as many of these powerful vessels as possible."

policy_operations_doctrine: "Fleet Operations Doctrine"
policy_operations_doctrine_desc: "A Navy has many duties: Power projection, defense of core territory, and the protection of internal trade. Our Fleet Operations Doctrine determines which of these tasks to emphasize."

standard_operations_name: "Standard Operations"
standard_operations: "Standard Operations"
standard_operations_desc: "We shouldn't over-specialize our Fleet Operations. We must be ready for any and all duties at all times, and never neglect one aspect of naval planning."

blue_sky: "Blue Sky Operations"
blue_sky_name: "Blue Sky Operations"
blue_sky_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defense of our planets and our people. Our Navy exists purely to defend our nation, and we should plan to keep our campaigns limited to space we control, and fight primarily with our mighty Starbases in support of our fleets."

black_sky: "Black Sky Operations"
black_sky_name: "Black Sky Operations"
black_sky_desc: "Our Navy must be able to project power far away from home--to protect our allies, punish our enemies, and respond to crises wherever they may arise. We cannot rely on Starbases to support our fleet; we must be able to fight anywhere, even across the galaxy. A Black Sky fleet is a tool of diplomacy, just like any other."

privateer_operation: "Anti-Piracy Operations"
privateer_operation_name: "Anti-Piracy Operations"
privateer_operation_desc: "Our fleets are more than sufficient to defend us and our way of life, but they are also instrumental in protecting our internal trade. Trade is the lifeblood of our Empire, and we must do everything we can to protect it."

policy_crew_doctrine: "Crew Training Doctrine"
policy_crew_doctrine_desc: "The training of a Navy's crews and officers is one of the most important aspect it ever undertakes. We should carefully tailor our training programs to fit our circumstances; outdated or maladapted training programs are worse than useless, and will cripple our Navy. We must decide how to train our crews and officers."

standard_crew: "Standard Training"
standard_crew_name: "Standard Training"
standard_crew_desc: "A standard level of training, without any specialized focus, will allow us to best maintain operational readiness."

excellent_crew: "Naval Academy Training"
excellent_crew_name: "Naval Academy Training"
excellent_crew_desc: "We must implement a full Naval Academy training program. Crews are to be trained for years, with potential officers given additional specialized training. However, many will fail to meet the high standards we set, reducing the pool of acceptable crews for our ships."

militia_crew: "Rapid Training"
militia_crew_name: "Rapid Training"
militia_crew_desc: "We must implement a rapid training program, focused on getting ship crews ready as soon as possible, without any advanced training. This will allow us to swell our ranks with many recruits to fill our ships, but will result in reduced combat performance."

ai_crew: "Artificial Intelligence Crews"
ai_crew_name: "Artificial Intelligence Crews"
ai_crew_desc: "We will crew our ships mostly with AI units. This has the advantage of producing ship crews at an impressive rate. However, AI units optimized for crew roles have difficulties adapting to rapidly altering situations, which will increase the number of casualties we take in battle."

edict_nsc_doctrine_ai: "AI Doctrine Replacement"
edict_nsc_doctrine_ai_desc: "For AI Only"

policy_crew_doctrine_gestalt: "Drone Crew Doctrine"
policy_crew_doctrine_gestalt_desc: "The training of a Navy's drones is one of the most important aspect it ever undertakes. We should carefully tailor our training programs to fit our circumstances; outdated or maladapted training programs are worse than useless, and will cripple our Navy. We must decide how to train our drones."

standard_drones: "Standard Drones"
standard_drones_name: "Standard Drones"
standard_drones_desc: "Our drones are sufficient at the moment; we do not require either higher quality drones, independent drones, or a swarm of naval drones."

quality_protocol: "Quality Protocol"
quality_protocol_name: "Quality Protocol"
quality_protocol_desc: "Our drones must be of the highest quality, to make our ships fight at peak efficiency. We will be unable to fill as many ships as we might have with more lax standards, but this is the price we pay for excellence."

adaptive_protocol: "Adaptive Protocol"
adaptive_protocol_name: "Adaptive Protocol"
adaptive_protocol_desc: "Our officer drones have been designed with more independent thought in order to adapt in different situations. This means that we can field more ships, with our officer drones able to manage their crews with more autonomy, but overall combat performance will suffer slightly from the lack of unified action."

swarm_protocol: "Swarm Protocol"
swarm_protocol_name: "Swarm Protocol"
swarm_protocol_desc: "Our drones require only minimal training. Our ships must be fast, and blot out the stars with their numbers; it does not take much training to do this. Each ship is a negligible loss; there are two more to take its place. The Swarm will overwhelm with sheer numbers."

 # Armies #

 pasmod_assault_army_default: "Planetary Assault Army"
 pasmod_assault_army_default_plural: "Planetary Assault Armies"
 pasmod_assault_army_default_DESC: "Elite troops trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. These "Space Marines" are fielded in smaller numbers than traditional assault armies, as there is limited room for soldiers and equipment aboard a proper warship."

 pasmod_assault_army_clone: "Clone Assault Unit"
 pasmod_assault_army_clone_plural: "Clone Assault army units"
 pasmod_assault_army_clone_DESC: "Elite specialized clone troopers bred and trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. Their lack of personal initiative is deemed an acceptable trade-off for their total obedience to orders and relative disposability."
 
 pasmod_assault_army_gene: "Orbital Drop Assault Division"
 pasmod_assault_army_gene_plural: "Orbital Drop Assault Divisions"
 pasmod_assault_army_gene_DESC: "Elite troops trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods.

 pasmod_assault_army_psionic_force_DESC:0 "Elite soldiers gifted with psionic abilities and trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. These psionic warriors focus on the use of destructive psionic powers to remove the enemy's willingness to fight, shattering their morale and winning quick victories with few casualties."
 
 pasmod_assault_army_slave_army:0 "Slave Troops"
 pasmod_assault_army_slave_army_DESC:0 "Slaves trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. Most are conscripted by force, but many slaves volunteer in a desperate attempt to increase their food rations or escape from grueling labor. As a bonus, slaves are inherently disposable; there are always more bodies to fuel the Empire's glorious expansion."

 pasmod_assault_army_droid_army:0 "Droid Army"
 pasmod_assault_army_droid_army_DESC:0 "Cold, heartless killing machines designed specifically to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. They are immune to the effects of poor morale that plague organic combat units, and will fight to the last droid standing. "
