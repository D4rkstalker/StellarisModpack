# amoeba eggs found
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.1.name: "Amoeba Eggs"
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.1.desc: "After detailed analysis, Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered that the strange cracked formations on the surface of [From.GetName] in fact are eggs! These eggs once contained babies of space amoeba, while the unborn eggs' larve were essentially useless, the fluid they were encased in has some interesting properties.\n\nThe viscosity and density of this fluid sludge is remarkable. It's an almost gaseous fluid that is packed with nutrients simular to the food we currently produce and eat.\n\nIn studying the eggs, the crew has made some exciting new findings that will undoubtedly aid us in our own research."
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.1.a: "Having amoeba food on hand could be useful."

# broken remnant starbase for how to produce ameobas
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.2.name: "Boilogical Ship Hatchery"
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.2.desc: "The crashed starbase turned out to be much more beneficial to study than we thought. Reconstruction of the Starbase revealed that their shipyard was configured to build or rather grow some sort of biological ship as well as creating more standard ships."
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.2.a: "Further reaserch into that technology could be useful to us."

# broken remnant starbase for how to produce ameobas + biomatter
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.3.name: "Boilogical Ship Hatchery"
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.3.desc: "Examining the contents of the destroyed station revealed a curious sight. Part of the station's outer ramparts were filled with long-dead space amoeba of various sizes; from hatchlings to fully grown adults. Nearby, there was an array of pod-like structures containing amoeba eggs.\n\nIt seems like the facilities on this station served to breed and nurture space amoeba. Though the purpose of their domesticated amoeba is unclear, we are certainly familiar with their resilience in combat."
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.3.a: "Perhaps we can hatch amoeba to serve in our navy."

# broken remnant tech planetside for how to produce ameobas
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.4.name: "Lost Research Notes"
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.4.desc: "There is nothing unusual about the research outpost itself. It is little but a temporary shelter erected against the savage elements, allowing surface-level planetary study for a limited time.\n\nThe outpost on [From.From.GetName] is well past the end of its lifespan, but it has yet to be critically damaged. The equipment - functional, cheap, intended to be abandoned - is well-used, and the local databanks are filled with detailed but mostly mundane accounts of the planet. However, one special project file stands out.\n\n Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the project's goal was the weoponization of biological spacefaring organisms to be used alongside the navy of this civilization. It's still unclear if the work was ultimately sucessful or not."
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.4.a: "Perhaps we can finish what they started."

# destroyed hatchery in orbit around star
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.5.name: "Biological Shipyards"
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.5.desc: “From what we have been able to reconstruct, the starbase’s biomatter appears to have have been centralized near its shipyards. [Root.GetLeaderName] theorizes that this structure was once used to create some kind of biological spacecraft.”
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.5.a: “Continue reverse engineering efforts.” 
war_amoeba_mod_anomaly.5.b: “Melt it down.”
