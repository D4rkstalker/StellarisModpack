Then an innovation in statecraft took hold: we let more nimble and efficient businesses start doing the government's work.

Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses, charities, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The revolution saw states swept aside and replaced with a variety of voluntary, competitive dispute resolution organizations and covenant communities.

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rogue_freehold_desc:0 "What started out simply as a radical attempt at near total privatization of the economy has turned into something more sinister, as the citizens of the freehold have become increasingly fond of slavery, piracy, and plunder. Since the highest courts have ruled all of those things legal against non-citizens, and since only those who can afford personhood rights insurance can become citizens... there is nothing to stop them indulging from such barbaric pursuits as long as the hated 'statists' are the target."

Slavery, banditry, murder, and theft - such things are now commonplace, one simply has to be wealthy enough to get away with them. Warlords, armed gangs, and rampant corporations now openly rule over the ruins of what was once supposedly a liberatory project. The most powerful rulers assert their dominance by launching piratical raids against the hated 'statists,' hauling back slaves and treasure to hawk for outrageous prices."

Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses,  voluntary societies, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The only barrier to action became what people were willing to pay or donate towards. Freed of state oppression, when even freedom itself is a commodity, there is no limit to what we may indulge in."
