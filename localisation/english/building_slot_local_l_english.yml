extra_building_slots_1:0 "Tectonic Control Systems"
extra_building_slots_1_desc:0 "Using hyper advanced technologies the local government is capable of analising and controlling the tectonic activity on a planet, thus improving infrastructure possibilities."

extra_building_slots_2:0 "System Miniaturisation"
extra_building_slots_2_desc:0 "Through research advancements in the field of technology miniaturisation we have been able to save just that bit more of a planet's usable surface for yet another infrastructure advancement."

extra_building_slots_3:0 "Power Relay Miniaturisation"
extra_building_slots_3_desc:0 "Advancements in our infrastructure technologies have allowed us to significantly decrease the size and space use of our power relays, giving more space to focus on the things that matter, like learning how to blow each other up in the best way."

extra_building_slots_4:0 "Powerplant Miniaturisation"
extra_building_slots_4_desc:0 "Powerplants are being replaced by smaller and more effecient versions left and right, allowing for the same performance with far less space."

extra_building_slots_5:0 "Graviton Reinforced Construction"
extra_building_slots_5_desc:0 "Using gravitons we have been able to prevent infrastructure built in a risky way from collapsing, allowing us to do more with the little space we have."

extra_building_slots_6:0 "Quantum Powered Construction"
extra_building_slots_6_desc:0 "Using our advanced understanding of quantum mechanics we have been able to further improve our infrastructure, allowing for even more sprawling construction in the same small amount of space."

extra_building_slots_7:0 "Neutron Star Compression Utilisation"
extra_building_slots_7_desc:0 "Through our research into neutron stars we have been able to learn how to further compress self maintaining structures on our colonies, allowing us to fit more in less space."

extra_building_slots_8:0 "Neutronium Reinforced Construction"
extra_building_slots_8_desc:0 "Using our knowledge about neutron stars and their illusive neutronium, we have been able to start integrating it into our infrastructure in a limited capacity, strengthening our structures, meaning we can now go even heigher into the atmosphere."

extra_building_slots_9:0 "Neutronium Integrated Construction"
extra_building_slots_9_desc:0 "Following our previous use of neutroniums in infrastructure construction, we have now found ways to fully integrate it into our structures, ensuring that height is not, and never will be, the limit."

extra_building_slots_10:0 "Dark Matter Infused Materials"
extra_building_slots_10_desc:0 "Through the study of black holes we were able to identify methods to extract dark matter, and now after much study we are able to infuse it into our infrastructure, creating energetic and powerful buildings, that are unlikely to colapse under most circumstances."

extra_building_slots_11:0 "Precursor Construction Technologies"
extra_building_slots_11_desc:0 "Using long lost technologies combined with our advanced understanding of science, we were able to reverse engineer some millenia old construction methods, that were thought to be long lost, increasing our maximum infrastructure density even further."
