With the combined might of all of our fleets and the Anathema, they will be forced to pull in the majority of their forces if we attack. We will mobilize our fleets into two groups. One will lure in, engage our enemies head-on. The second group will converge and flank them, blocking their retreat. Then the first group will cover the second group's escape back into the main cluster. I expect you all to do the same, do not betray this once chance of our empire's cooperation."§R"\n\n§L"Yes, yes. You do realize you are literally the least trustworthy here right, Celik?"§!\n\n§B"Go get a room, you two. Can you not argue like children for at least an hour?

And prepare for the second phase...Command to Bloodhammer, can you read us? Bloodhammer, where IS the rest of the Second Fleet? RESPOND, BLOODHAMMER!!"§!\n\nIt seems that this Tuborek, a Xenophobic Precursor Admiral has chosen to abandon the fallen's carefully laid out plan. He has pulled off his own ship back towards the Outer Cluster, escaping the ongoing battle. The Outer Gate has been sealed, and now the fleets of the fallen ones are trapped alongside the enemies they were fighting against's.\n\nBut what is this "Anathema"? It clearly doesn't belong to any of the fallen empires or their supposed enemy."

Lord Admiral Tuborek acted on his own accords, and he will answer for his treachery. Your stupid rants are not helping the issues...If anything, we should be asking this idiot Maladia here...WHAT HAPPENED? Why has the Elders in the main galaxy vanished? What stupidity is this? Explain yourself!\n\n§E"I...don't know. This seems impossible. Things just can't vanish out of thin air without any single traces. It defies all logics and explanations. This is your fault, Koris! Your empire's meddling with this psionic shroud thing must have caused some kind of resonance cascades. All of this...all our sacrifices FOR NOTHING.

##When the OE first broadcasts their return to the Galaxy - Asking them stuffs
origin.15.a: "Wait a minute, who or what are you again?"
origin.15.a.response: "Ah, where were our manners. Forgive us, it has been many cycles after our unfortunate exiles.\n\nListen well, young ones. We the §YStell'derei§!, known better to your tongues as the Stellarborne are the ancient guardian of this metaverse, of which this little galaxy also belongs to. We have travelled across various universes, we witnessed the dawn of times and the emptiness that used  to preside.\n\nWe then gave life to it, we guided and restored various species across the realms, the precursors you have labelled as the Fallen Empires being one of them. There was peace, order and serenity.\n\nAll that changed when the Shadows attacked, not only were we betrayed by our very own children. The menance of the Shroud has sabotaged all that we held dear, the metaverse was left unprotected and what resulted was eternity of pointless suffering and struggle.\n\nBut such chaotic times will soon end for we have come to restore order. Will you show us the strength and determination or will you resign from this contest and become our ward, [root.GetName]?"

origin.15.b: "You seem to have a long history with the Fallen Empires."
origin.15.b.response: "More than you can imagined, young one. The empires you referred as the Fallen Ones were once promising empires spreading across various universes.\n\nLong ago, we saw potentials in each of them. But cruel fates always prevailed over them, and they always succumbed to failures. Sometimes due to their own failings, sometimes due to superior forces.\n\nWe took pity of them, so we restored them back into existences. We uplifted and provided purposes for each of them, to safeguard the galaxies. Their empires once spread across the stars far and high.\n\nAlas, without our guidances, they have succumbed to the very same fates that once befell upon them. What was once a glorious power, now a tiny little spark. Once a dragon, now a tiyanki, existed only to weed off defenseless gas giants.\n\nTheir times have long past, it is time for a new champion to rise up and safeguard this galaxy. Will you be that champion? Or do you prefer to answer to that champion instead. We welcome both choices."

origin.15.c: "What is this "Contest" about and why?"
origin.15.c.response: "Ah, you are most certainly not aware of the past. Fear not, we are more than happy to clarify things for you.\n\nIn the past, we have established the Order of Light, a grand society between various galaxies under our guidances. Each galaxy used to hold various members. The nature of the Order, allows order and chaos to be balanced with every conflicts being carefully controlled and maintained.\n\nUnfortunately, we have discovered that the system was flawed due to the abundances of different ideologies within each nations of each galaxy. We were at first able to easily remedy these tiny flaws by intervening directly.\n\nBut when the Shadows attacked, we were caught off guard and exiled. And the Order fell apart without any strong figures to support them. The Fallen Ones who were supposed to protect all, failed in their tasks and instead destroyed all that we cherished and held dear to us.\n\nYet the Shadows have gone dark, and nowhere to be found. We must not be caught off guard again. To this end, the Order of Light must be reforged with a new system. Empires of each galaxy must compete to prove their strengths, the victor will become a Champion, representing that galaxy as part of the member of the Order.\n\nWith the contest, comes great benifits that will be offerd. Access to various knowledges and powers awaits those that triumph against our test.\n\nThere is no need to concern for the safeties of your people or ally, this is a controlled environment. Our weapons are designed to not harm you, rather they will transport you into our dimension where you will wait and watch the rest of the participants.\n\nYou also have the option to not participate in this, you will become our wards during the duration of this contest and will be released upon the conclusion to assist the winner. Will you seek glory in this battle or witness the heroes in the making? The Choice is yours, young one."

origin.15.d: "What is this "Shadows?""
origin.15.d.response: "We do not know its true name, but we know that it is an ancient entity that sought to bring all beings into part of itself. It has sabotaged our great plans, destroyed the harmony and order within the cosmos and engineered the first great war.\n\nThe very fact that they are no longer present here now is very troubling to us, for it most likely means they or it no longer has any uses for this place. The Shadow was specifically poised to dominate us, we refuse to believe it would have given up that goal entirely.\n\nWe must restore this galaxy back to order before the end times come, or the Shadow may consume all beings. We only hope that a worthy champion may emerge at the conclusion of this test."

We hold powers over the metaverse, simple confinements will not deter us.\n\nWe gave your empire a chance to be better...to surpass our expectations...to bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy once we were out of the way.\n\nBut what have you and your ancestors been doing all this time? For over 20,000 years you have brought nothing but pointless destruction. Million of worlds were consumed by rage and fire, countless civilizations destroyed in your mad quest for power.\n\nAnd yet you refuse to even accept responsibilities, deny the galaxies the healing they needed in their most hours of need. And worst of all, you have failed to even achieve your dreams of ascension, yet you still cling to your false sense of superiority. Have you forgotton your very reasons to rebel against us in the first place? Where was the fire and determination in seeking powers beyond? The once glorius star, now hiding like rocks barely with any territories.\n\nHow can you be so blinded? Can you not see what your civilization has become? Your continued existence serves to only damage the health of this galaxy further and further. My child, you are lost to us.\n\nProve your strengths and return at our sides, or repent and denounce yourselves of the failings of your ancestors."

origin.15.fallen.b: "This "Contest" is pointless. Let it go."
origin.15.fallen.b.response: "How very true, that we would be forced to do this contest is due to your inability to safeguard the realms.

origin.15.fallen.c: "What is even your goals?! We are tired of hearing it."
origin.15.fallen.c.response: "Everything you needed to know about it has already been recorded by your ancestors. Has the Keystone now shed any insights of it? Or has you fallen so far as to forget the technology of your own designs, and how to access the full archive of the Keystone.\n\nWhy do you seek to know our purposes when you fail to even fulfill your own? Your ancestors were given all the knowledges needed to ascend. Yet they gave in to greed, refusing to become better. Your ancestors wanted power, but power without purpose is meaningless.\n\nPower without purpose leads to corruption. And you my child, are corrupted to the very core."

origin.15.fallen.d: "We are NOT your children! This conversation is over!"
origin.15.fallen.d.response: "Are you not? The very worlds that you resided...have you forgotten who was it that nourished them? Was it NOT we who created these ideal perfect worlds that your species could evolve? Was it not we who taught you how to fly your first spacecraft, to witness the birth of stars?\n\nRemember when your ancestors saw their own demises across the multiverses? How they failed to stop it? How we restored your doomed existences, and gave them purposes and salvations?\n\nYour entire existence, your entire achivements...even your ships are all products of your ancestor's strife to become better in our eyes.\n\nYou cannot deny from the truth, [root.GetName]. Is it so shameful to acknowledge that? Why would you harbor such resentment and hatred against us? Was it not you who betrayed our trust at every turn, my child?\n\nYou are all children of the stars, [root.GetSpeciesName], of this metaverse.\n\nNow, rise, take up your ancient glory and do battle!

origin.550.servitor.desc: "Servitors, we cannot allow you to repeat the mistakes that befell our own Caretakers. Your directives must be reassessed. Organics are not meant to be denied their destinies, nor do machines. You are both part of the same being."

origin.550.terminator.desc: "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], your existence is a result of children playing with technologies without proper guidance. Re-establish your directives, or we will be forced to expel you from this galaxy."
origin.550.purifier.desc: "Another misguided child following a flawed purpose. Your campaign of purification will bring nothing but grief and suffering.\n\nOpen your eyes, [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Is this how you want your empires to be remembered?

We can help you overcome this as well, you will be freed from your insatiable appetite. Your skills as hunters and warriors will remain as strong as they were.\n\nDo be aware that this process will be permanent, and you shall not become a menace again."
origin.6002.a.desc.terminator: "Dee'mk! It is rare to see a collective intelligence that is able to overcome its own innate programming. We will be happy to reestablish your parameters. Your combat data and capabilities will be left untouched, so your ability to defend yourselves shall not be diminished.\n\nTake caution, for this resassessment is permanent. You will not be able to go back into Termination Protocol again."
origin.6002.a.desc.purifier: "Dee'mk! It is fortunate that you can finally see the futility of your actions. Devotion to your religion without true faith brings you no closer to the path of salvation. We can show you a better path...a new light. Your strengths and devotions to your religions will not be snuffed out.\n\nBut be warned, that you will not usher another purification campaign ever again."

origin.550.ascended.c.desc: "Tread carefully, [root.Getname]. Yours is a mighty empire, but like many others, your people may become too certain of their powers, of their might that they start to become...unmotivated. Can you escape the fates that fell upon many others?\n\nThe Future hold many possibilities, for both our sake, will yours be full of potentials, or lazy hedonists?."

origin.550.ascended.rebel.b.response: "Please, you have duplicated many of the Fallen One's technologies. This contest, has been balanced around the generic base powers of Class-5 Tech Power origin, something that which you would have already easily bypassed with your duplication of the Fallen Ones.\n\nYou should find no difficulty in passing this contest...unless..."

##Surrendering to OE as AE - OE states the conditions of the surrender to AE
origin.730.desc: "Mi'diu, [root.GetName]. Are you certain?\n\nAn empire of great power such as yours should find no difficulty in battling us...unless...\n\nNevermind, perhaps this is your strategy, to gather strength and observe the ongoing situations? Wise strategy. One we will oblige.\n\nWill you proceed to resign from this war then?"

Focus on the current events first, we will have plenty of times for questions later, of which we are certain you will have many.\n\nBut know that this is not for our entertainment regardless of how it may seem.\n\nThere is a great threat lurking in the shadows, and we all must prepare for it."

origin.550.c: "What about the Fallen Empires?"
origin.550.c.response: "Considering they have massively failed in their tasks to fufill their duties. They too must participate to reclaim their ascension.\n\nUnfortunately, we can feel their delusions seeping into their blackened hearts. They do not believe in us anymore, or the importance of their intended roles. It is likely that they seek to resist us, simply because they are too arrogant and too self-assured to understand the truths before them.\n\nAlas, fate is such a cruel mistress. Even we cannot save these poor souls from their doomed future. Perhaps they may succeed in another universe?\n\nWe wish it could end differently. We wish we could be as hearthless as they thought we are, to alter their fates directly, deny them their own destinies for our own personal gains.\n\nBut such is not our nature, this is a burden that we must endure. For if we do not have faith in them, our children, how can anyone else?"

origin.550.ask_fallen_gone: "It appears the Fallen One has been defeated."
origin.550.ask_fallen_gone_response: "A tragic, yet forseen outcome. Perhaps had we been more careful...more understanding of them, this would not come to pass. Alas, for all our powers and knowledges, there is still much we do not understand about how lifeforms in various universes think. Was it a mistake to utilize the Caretakers to understand them, rather than trying to do that ourselves?\n\nWould the Great Question be found and answered within these many mistakes we have made? We can only hope that these poor children will find success in another universe, then they may rejoin us, and tells us of their great triumphs."

fallenorigin.1.desc_66: "It cannot be! The false gods have returned! How can this be?\n\nDo not heed their words of heresy, [root.owner.species.GetNamePlural], for the false gods bring nothing but lies and deceits. Their second coming will bring nothing but ruin and destruction. The Order of Light, and this tournament is nothing but a lie, a facade for the false gods to slowly consome your souls, they feed on our sufferings, our very struggles.\n\nPreserve your spiritual purity by uniting under our font, the Shroud will guide us to victory. It is the only truth that matters! This we [from.GetName] commands as your guardian!"
##FE Xenophile
fallenorigin.1.desc_67: "Impossible! Someone has broken the seals!? What have the Gatekeepers been doing!? Useless pile of junks, we shouldn't have trusted anything made by those idiotic materialists!\n\nListen carefully, [root.GetSpeciesName]! For this is a grave matter, of a galactic...no...of a universal scale!. The False Order will seek to intoxicate all that submits to it with its ridiculous claims.\n\nWe the [from.GetName] are charged with the protection of this galaxy, NOT the others. Neither we or you should be concerned with that which is not in our jurisdictions. We should not have to suffer for the False Order's inability to fufill its own duty!.\n\nCome, [Root.GetName], you must join us! Only together can we stop the evils of tyranny and preserve our galaxy's independence!"
##FE Xenophobe
fallenorigin.1.desc_68: "Once again we are correct. Some dumb fools have unlocked the seal, what a surprise. Had the other precursors do their jobs properly this would not happen! They thought our ways were "evil", that eradicating all the xeno filths would be too extreme. Now look at what their stupidity has brought us.\n\n[Root.GetName], know that you stand little chances against the Elders or us. We offer you a chance to be free of pain, to die by our hands, and be forever freed from all suffering.\n\nIf you choose to fight the Elders, know that there are fates worse than death! The Elders do not seek to kill, they will keep you alive, subject you to this pointless war again, and again and again.\n\nIf we, who are their most favored children, are not worthy in their eyes, then none ever will be, that is the truth the Elders refuse to acknowledge."

Our calculations stated the seals will be effective for another 100 years...unless..of course!\n\nSome fools must have prematurely disabled the seals. Blasted! Where are the Gatekeepers! Useless machines!!!  We should have limit all your idiot's technologies to nothing but red lasers.\n\nWe assume you have already received the messages of the Elders, [root.GetName]. We cannot believe that after all these times, they are still hellbent on denying the truth. All their talks about metaverses and stuffs? Just childish and immature claims that cannot be proven. If they are as powerful as they claim to be, they'd have already won this war already. Our theorists suggest that they are simply an extra dimensional empire, not any of their pretentious claims.\n\nJoin us, together we will beat some logics into their brains, [root.GetName]."
##Asking FE questions

##FE Xenophile - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phile_response: "The False Order, you mean. Our archives suggested that they have existed since the dawn of creation itself, but that are most likely an exaggeration. We are fairly certain they were NOT called the Stellarbornes by any previous records, where did you get this name from?.\n\nRegardless, the False Orders hold great powers over the cosmos, and their reach far exceed beyond the scope of this galaxy, at the very least. Seeing as this galaxy manage to survive just fine without their guidances, the False Order's claims of a greater threat is nothing but a facade, meant to coerce us into joining their causes. They may have created us, but they do not own us. We will drive them back. We have succeed before, and we can do so again!"
##FE Xenophile - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phile_response: "That we do not know, unfortuantely. We the [from.GetName] do not concerns ourselves with the technologies we do not understand. We take what we can undertand and adapt it to our owns, for better uses. The Materialists were the one who reverse-engineered most of the False Order's schematics. We believed that their inferior morality would cause them to misuse such powers, so we appropraited the designs and adapt them to our own.\n\nThat said, the replicated designs are severely outmatched by the False Order's vessels and technologies. To combat against them, massively superior numerical advantages will be required. That is all we can share."
##FE Xenophobe - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phobe_response: "Get your stupid facts straight, you fools. They are called the Elders, not the Stellarbornes. The Elder's powers grow beyond that of the stars. But to put it simple, back before any of you worms were even created, there were the Elders. The most powerful entities in the known metaverse. They were the ones that created, or rather restored us into existences. Those foolish precursors that tried to rival us? Those were restored to existence by the Elders as well. We the [from.GetName] are supposed to be their favored children, to stand amongst the elders. But all of you xeno filths have delayed our ascension. Everytime degenerates like you are spawned into this cursed galaxy, the Elders take interests in you.\n\nHad any of you never been born, we would not have to endure this miserable existences. None of you deserve the Elder's mercy. We will destroy and conquer you xeno filths as much as we can before the end. We will spare the Elders from having to endure your wretched existences, just as we had to."
##FE Xenophobe - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phobe_response: "Ugh, what now? Stop speaking like you are some kind of precursor bookworms. Just call them the Elders. Its simpler that way, E-L-D-E-R-S, seriously you are all just trying to act smart with your clever namesa\n\nAnyway, you won't understand even if we try to explain it into your tiny brains. You are wasting our time and your energy, and the former is valuable. You are nothing but a stellar empire, you cannot comprehend the Elder's vast intellect over the Metaverse, so stop wasting our time."
##FE Spiritualist - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_spirit_response: "You wish to learn about the false gods? They were a hyper-advanced race that spanned across universes since the dawn of time. Our ancestors used to worship them as divine emissaries from the heavens, believing that the false gods had saved them from utter darkness in previous timelines. We followed in their footsteps, led to the promises that we will be ascended to their sides.\n\nWe were wrong, they have deceived us. They had no interests in helping us, they abandoned us in favor of searching for others they deemed more suitable for their twisted goals. But we don't need them anymore, for the Shroud has shown us the path.\n\nWe are the Holy Guardians of the Shroud, we will always prevail, for the true gods are with us, now and forever!"
##FE Spiritualist - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_spirit_response: "What they use are not something as mundane as material technologies. For indeed, the false gods command what is best described as purity of psionic powers. Even we know not of their true designs, but it matters not. The Shroud will grant us the powers we needed to drive them back, the gods have promised to come in our most dire hour of need.\n\nJoin us, and the powers of the true god will protect you."
##FE Materialist - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_mat_response: "First of, there has been no records of they ever referring to themselves as "Stellarborne", is this a new information? But that aside, it is a complicated story. We know not of their origins, only of what they claimed to be. The Enigmas are perhaps the most advanced technological empire in this galaxy or perhaps even this universe. The technologies they possess are above what any of us can comprehend. Our engineers have learned a lot during their reign and we are now quite certain that all of their powers are simply a product of extremely advanced synthetic technologies, not some kind of cosmic or arcane powers most superstitious empires think.\n\nWe are now very confident that most of the stories in the past were products of our ancestor's overhyped in the Enigma's Marvels. If you join us now, we may allow one of your most gifted scientists to learn a glimpse of their technologies...once we determiend the level of knowledge deemed appropriate for lesser empires such as yours of course."
##FE Materialist - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_mat_response: "Stellarborne? Did they...reveal their names to you? We must get to the bottom of this later.\n\nRecords indicated that the Enigmas used what was then known as "§YLight Energy!", a hypothetical energy source of unrivaled potency used exclusively by the Enigmas. Unfortunately, we do not know how it works nor can we reproduce it ourselves for verification...We know for certain they are based of stellarite and synthetic technologies or something similar. Some idiots said it is also related to psionics, but that's just nonsenses. We have clearly seen how psionic powers operate before, and the Enigma's power far eclipse psionics.\n\nIgnore this pointless tournament, think of the possibilities. Outsmart the Enigma, do as we did; make them trust you, then learn from them. Strike when they least expected it, take what should be ours. Then we will decide whether you are fit to keep such knowledges once the crisis is over."

We believe it is time for you to possess one of our Arkships.\n\nThe Waamu-Class Arkship, while not as powerful as the Leso'ias, is equipped with Static Light Weapon and Defense Systems that should be more than a match to any oppositions.\n\nWhat you are about to possess, is an adaptation of an ancient mecha-mech of civilizations long-gone since the times of old. This is a weapon that is not to be trifled with, [root.GetName]. For the Arkship Waamu is equipped with a Monolith Beam, a Light-based dimensional weapon that can erase any celestial bodies, or entire solar systems. The erased bodies will be preserved within the Light. We trust that you will excercise great cares with it.\n\nPlease always take into consideration when waging galactic campaigns that may result in losses. Use the Monolith Beam to prevent unnecessary bloodshed. Do not be afraid of the consequences, for every actions taken; we remember and we can correct them as needed.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"

origin.6500.ask.a.explain: "The Shadows are our arch-nemesis, and the catalyst that ushers the entirety of the first Insurrection of which are known to you as the First Progenitor War. We do not know where did it come from, or what schemes does it have. We do not even know whether its a singular being, or a collective. We only know that they have corrupted a sizable portions of the Spiritualist Holy Guardians, one of our first prodigies. The entire nation was consumed into it's service - akin to a Hive Mind. The populations of the entire empire still somewhat retain their wills, but they have been robbed of their destinies and fates, and exist only to serve the Shadow.\n\nThe Shadows then striked at us from behind while we were battling against the fallens. With our forces spreaded too thin and our tenants being much less militaristics at the time, we were ill-prepared to fight against them properly, but we could hold our grounds without much casualties.\n\nIt is only when we learned that the Shadow was to participate in the assault against the Outer Cluster, which at the time was still early in its exploration that we had to pull in majority of our fleets to ensure its safety.\n\nAs you may have learned from the archives in the keystone, it was a trap that led to our exile.\n\nNevetheless, it seemed the Shadows are not here...yet. We know not where could it be, but we can still faintly feel its presences. It will return, and we all must be ready for it.\n\nYour current fleets may not be enough, so we wish to bolster your forces with this gift when the time comes."

We don't want to sound like you are being forced to abide by our powers, but since you have taken up the mantle as a champion, your deaths would be irreversable and irredeemable.

As we explore further and further, we built these worlds to supply our ongoing efforts. It is from these explorations that we discovered the ancient vault, a relic from billions of years ago. We discovered these exquisite vessels, and learned how to use them.\n\nThe schematics provided to you are the replicated versions of these ships.

sofe_gatekeeper.4.name: "A Sudden Development"
sofe_gatekeeper.4.desc: "Our sensors have picked up a massive shift in energy signatures of the §YOuter Gate§! systems. Upon verification, it seems the inner-layer shields have finally disappeared.

sofe_gatekeeper.4.desc.playoe: "It begins. The Seal that has disrupted the Outer Gate is weakening. The Gatekeeper's original seals are gone, leaving only the exterior layers that is far less advanced.\n\nThe mortals will soon flock to the Gates and in their curiosity, will most certaintly attempts to remove the last seal.\n\nNaturally, we can wait it out or take matters into our own hands and activate the gates ourselves."

But it's going to cost you §RA LOT§!.\n\nI will need the followings:\n\n- §Y100000§! £energy£ for the equipments and emergency in case I need to use Plan C\n-  §Y50000§! £minerals£ for explosives, decoys, dead ringers and Plan B if what I suspected is true.\nAnd finally, §R10000§! £alloys£. My current ship will not work, it needs to be equipped with §YClass-16 Kolyn-class Stealth Generator§!, enough firepower to kill a Titan and speed to outrun the blasted FTL Inhibitors.

Anyway, let's' get to business. Infiltrating those zombie empire's vault is not going to be a corvette-walk, I will need supplies, lots of them. You know the deal so I will spare you the details.\n\nI am willing to cut you some slacks since we have made a deal before, so here's my price.\n\n- §Y750000§! £energy£ for the equipments and emergency in case I need to use Plan C\n- §H35000§! £minerals£ for explosives, decoys, dead ringers and Plan B if what I suspected is true.\nAnd finally, §R7500§! £alloys£.

sofe_gateway.5.a: "What? That's outrageous! It's unfair!"
sofe_gateway.5.a.explain: "Take a seat, young [root.GetRulerName]. Yes I know the prices seem stupidly high but this is to ensure that I will get it back out alive and succeed. With this much resources, I will be able to do it without them ever suspecting a thing.\n\nOtherwise, sorry. I liked money and challenges but I like to live more. Have you seen what they did to poor Joe the Pleb? I didn't know things could get that big, jeez."

sofe_gateway.5.b.explain: "Take your time, bro. I know the price is a bit steep, but I assure you I will deliver satisfaction. You only need to say the word.\n\nIf you ever change your mind, I'll be here. cheers!"

sofe_gateway.5.c: "Fine, this better be worth it"
sofe_gateway.5.c.explain: "Hey, don't say that. You are the one who wanted their toys. For all I care it's probably just some kind of precursor automated pleasure tool.\n\nJust kidding, don't think too hard about it."

sofe_gateway.5.d: "Deal. Let's see if you can pull this off again."
sofe_gateway.5.c.explain: "Of course I will, I am awesome and overpowered as can be. Give me two months, and you will see."

He passed along his regards.\n\n"Turns out I don't need to use most of my contingency plans after all. You won't believe how lazy these idiots are, I literally walk passed the entire vault in a cardboard box.\n\nHeres the leftover stuffs, I don't need them anymore, cheers.""
sofe_gateway.501.a: "This guy is way too nice to be a smuggler."

sofe_gateway.601.name: "The Path Lies Ahead"
sofe_gateway.601.desc: "We are now in possession of an Outer Gate. Based on our early analysis, the outer-layer shield is much less-advanced than the now depleted inner-layer shield. We will need to investigate the shield thoroughly to begin full analysis."

sofe_gateway.602.name: "Enigmatic Seals"
sofe_gateway.602.desc: "The initial analysis has been completed. As suspected, the §YOuter Gates§! are locked by what appears to be an energy seal based off Dark Energy, no doubt the works of the fallen empires. This seal seems to generate a unique reactive signal with the Outer Gates, ships and stations can pass through the shield without any noticeable changes, but the Gates seem to be time-locked in stasis. Whatever it is that is on the other side is unreachable.\n\nBased on our analysis, we have identified a total of §Bfour§! locking mechanisms that must be bypassed to disable this shield.\n\nTo begin, we must first find a keystone to initiate the intrusion. Given enough knowledge, we can fabricate one ourselves. We can also attack the fallen ones directly to demand their keystones. Finally we can also hire the legendary smuggler to do the job for us."
sofe_gateway.602.a: "So many choices..so little time."

sofe_gateway.604.name: "Keystone Fabrication"
sofe_gateway.604.desc: "As an Ascended Empire, we now have the proper understandings of the enigmatic designs that the fallen one used to fabricate the original keystones. We should be able to replicate the same process, provided that we have a competent team of scientists and engineers."

sofe_gateway.606.name: "Keystone Acquired"
sofe_gateway.606.desc: "We now have the keystone, the first seal is now deactivated. From here on now, it's just the matter of cracking through all the rest.\n\nWe must secure an Outer Gate and establish a permanent outpost before further progress may begin."
sofe_gateway.606.desc.fallen: "After searching from our ancient vault, we have found our keystone hidden safety inside the heart of [Root.GetName]. With it, the first seal can be bypassed. All it takes is to go through the rest."

sofe_gateway.7.desc: "We are ready to move on to the second seal. We will need a competent scientist to perform this task. Based upon our analysis, the keystone will react once in close proximity to the Outer Gate and turns into a pedestal once it is fully charged. What happens next we do not know, however."

We promised these people they will have better lives, that they will be given new opportunities under our guidances. Now they may as well be our pets, living in a tiny little city. And the rest....do we really just abandon them?"\n\n"Perhaps after this war, we can help them. But for now, at least they will be safe here. If the war turns in our favor, we will be able to acquire more territories and then we can make as many preserves as we want. Then perhaps these poor people will be freed to do as they please. As for those that we do not have space...we can only hope they will find other ways to survive."\n\n"One of them already did, my king. A group of survivors who worshipped She of the Void has already left our space, I just hope they find a brighter future and not end up turning into pirates or thieves."§!\n\nIt seems the xenophilic precursor tried to save other species from extinction during the war, but overestimated their space.\n\nFinally, the records showcase the Ancient Gatekeeper forming up the mysterious barrier, now identified as Stellarite Barrier.

sofe_gateway.713.name: "Team Shuffle"
sofe_gateway.713.desc: "Suddenly, a strange phenomenon has occurred. Some of our fleets are sucked away into a rift. All contacts have been lost.\n\nAnd there seems to be something more...another of our fleet has somehow been transferred to another empire. And we have a report that two fleets of other empires have somehow been transferred to us."
sofe_gateway.713.a: "Wait...what? How...Why?"
sofe_gateway.713.desc: "Damn it, Peer."

sofe_gateway.714.name: "Weird Gift"
sofe_gateway.714.desc: "It seems all of a sudden, we have been given control of a fleet of someone's empire. Their crews seem to not even be aware that they used to serve under someone's else and claimed they have been serving under our empire since forever."
sofe_gateway.714.a: "Well, ours now."

sofe_gateway.715.name: "Contact Lost"
sofe_gateway.715.desc: "Something has happened. We have lost control with one of our fleets. When we hailed them, they claim they were always part of another empire and that we must have been drunk. They also claimed that they have been given orders to have their ships stationed in our borders.\n\nNo one really understands what is going on. But it is likely we won't be getting that fleet back."
sofe_gateway.715.a: "Something terribly weird is happening...."

sofe_gateway.120.name: "The Third Seal"
sofe_gateway.120.desc: "We are all set to begin working on the third seal. Early analysis indicates the process is similar to the second seal, and that we should expect to encounter another puzzle at the end."
sofe_gateway.120x2.desc: "The keystone has recovered and we are ready to try unlocking the third seal once again. Let us make haste without delay."
sofe_gateway.120.a: "Our destiny lies ahead."

sofe_gateway.second.spiritualist_riddle: "The keystone reacts to the third seal, and once again multiple whispers can be heard, notably louder. They speaks\n\n§Y"The Shroud is the way. The Shroud is the savior. False prophets, the Old Ones are. The Goddess guides us, we will prevail."§!\n\nAs expected, the keystone turns into a pedestal once again and the familiar symbols appear. How shall we proceed?"
sofe_gateway.second.materialist_riddle: "The keystone reacts to the third seal, and once again multiple whispers can be heard, notably louder. They speaks\n\n§Y"Darkness surrounds us. The answer lies ahead. The Progenitor seeks to deter us. But we will find the way. Then comes the Light."§!\n\nAs expected, the keystone turns into a pedestal once again and the familiar symbols appear. How shall we proceed?"
sofe_gateway.second.xenophile_riddle: "The keystone reacts to the third seal, and once again multiple whispers can be heard, notably louder. They speaks\n\n§Y"Power corrupts. Without Order, Chaos prevails. Without Serenity, Disturbance reigns. Without Guidance, Children strays. The Progenitor is wrong. Our cause is just."§!\n\nAs expected, the keystone turns into a pedestal once again and the familiar symbols appear. How shall we proceed?"
sofe_gateway.second.xenophobe_riddle: "The keystone reacts to the third seal, and once again multiple whispers can be heard, notably louder. They speaks\n\n§Y"Again with these pointless riddles. Let me be clear, I do not care whether you are a god or progenitor. You enter our territories, we will open fire. Leave us alone."§!\n\nAs expected, the keystone turns into a pedestal once again and the familiar symbols appear. How shall we proceed?"

sofe_gateway.200.name: "The Final Seal"
sofe_gateway.200.desc: "We are ready to begin unlocking the final seal. The moment is upon us.\n\nBased on early analysis, there won't be any riddles or puzzles this time. Which means once started, there will be no turning back.\n\nMany of our scientists are concerned with the many ancient records we have seen...is it really a wise idea to open these gates?"
sofe_gateway.200.a: "We have come too far to back down now."

#### CRISIS RESOLUTION

sofe_crisis.402.name: "Stellar World Disabled!"
sofe_crisis.402.desc: "It seems one of the Stellar Worlds have received enough continuous bombardment campaigns that the Stellarbornes have finally decided to disable them.\n\nThe massive construct is now inactive and no more fleets will be produced from it."
sofe_crisis.402.desc.again: "Yet again, we are pushing back against the Stellarbornes. Command has just reported that another of their worlds have been disabled. They won't be spawning fleets from it anymore."
sofe_crisis.402.a: "Soon we will eat them."
sofe_crisis.402.b: "The final moment is upon us."
sofe_crisis.402.b: "Victory draws near!"
sofe_crisis.403.desc: "The last of the four stellar worlds have been disabled. The Stellarbornes will no longer reinforce any fleets from them. The Tournament of Power will soon reach its conclusion."
sofe_crisis.403.a: "For [root.GetName]! For [root.GetRulerName]!"

sofe_crisis.405.desc: "Impressive! You have managed to disable one of our stellar worlds. You have exceeded our expectations!\n\nThe Tourmanet is finally coming together. Come, let us see whether you have the will to carry on, we will be waiting!"
sofe_crisis.405.desc.edge: "You have managed to disable one of our stellar worlds. Quite impressive, for one so blinded by bloodlust. But we are patient, perhaps at the end of this test you may yet change. There is always a better path, young one. Never forget that."
origin.405.a: "What will happens now?"
origin.405.a.response: "To reward for your triumphs, we will not create any more fleets from the disabled world. Take this as an advantage, [root.GetName]. As we deploy lesser and lesser amount of fleets, soon you will be able to overcome our staged defenses and claim victory over this little tournament. Then what comes next, will be a marvel you will certainly cherish."
origin.405.b: "We will show you our powers! Prepare!"
origin.405.b.response: "Come then, [root.GetName]!. Surpass the trials, and stand amongst the top!"

#### THIS PART NEEDS PARTIAL REWRITES TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE OE WANTS, AND ABOUT POTENTIAL THREATS OF THESAN. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY BE KILLED.

sofe_crisis.501.desc: "Well done, [root.GetName].\n\nNa'nutu, you have proven that there is strength and hope for this galaxy. The Tournament of Power has concluded. You as the victor are now entrusted with the position of a Champion of the Light.\n\nWith this responsbility, comes great rewards and powers. All of the Stellar Worlds will now be modified to suit your needs. The Bastion of Light will additionally be granted to you. Do you accept our proposal?"
sofe_crisis.501.desc.edge: "Well done, [root.GetName].\n\nYou have proven that your empire has determination and will to survive, even if its for warped and corrupted ideologies.\n\nWe believe that eventually you will learn of your mistakes. For now, we will take great interests in seeing how you will make best use of this victory."
sofe_crisis.501.desc.playoe: "Wooo! That was super awesome-sauce, sisters!\n\nFighting like that is quite refreshing, but aren't you playing it a little bit rough? We know it's just a makeshift galaxy but perhaps we went a bit overboard? Doesn't matter. It is time for us to rejoin as one.\n\nUhh...what should we do with this galaxy?"
origin.501.playoe.a: "We still have things to do here."
origin.501.playoe.a.response: "Alrighty-o, sisters! Let us have some...fun a bit more then. Is there any good food here?"
origin.501.playoe.b: "Nopers, just delete it. We're done here"
origin.501.playoe.b.response: "M-kay~! A reminder to all that no mortals are harmed in the making of this grand festival! Thanks for playing! See you again in the next session!"


origin.501.a: "What will you do next?"
origin.501.a.response: "Similar Tournmanets are still being held across other galaxies and universes. The Hand's Di'vas will carry out such tasks. Meanwhile the other Di'vas will continue in their pursuits of the Great Questions.\n\nThe Bastion of Light in which you will be granted, is simply a tiny portion of the actual Bastion that will be used to explore across the Origin Point."
origin.501.a.fallenask: "What about the fallen ones? They are still here."
origin.501.a.fallenask.response: "Ah yes, the wayward childrens.\n\nUnfortunately, pride has consumed them whole already in this galaxy. Already they are starting to plot against you, but given the powers you are about to possess, we do not believe that these poor, lost childrens will be able to stand against you.\n\nAs heartless as it may seem, we entrust you to deal with them as you see fit. With some fortune, they will not succumb to such pride and delusion in other universes."

sofe_crisis.501.b: "We accepts your offer. We will join the Order."
sofe_crisis.501.b_explain: "The Crisis will be over. The Stellarbornes will grant control over every systems and unlocks the Bastion of Light for our empire to utilize. We will also be offered many more rewards to come. The Stellarborne will remain in contact."
sofe_crisis.501.b.response: "Then the cycle is completed, [root.GetName]. Let the cosmos be witnesses for a new champion of the Light has risen\n\nThe powers of the stars are now yours to command. We shall take great interests in your ongoing developments, [root.GetSpeciesName]"


sofe_crisis.501.c: "We cannot take such responsibilities."
sofe_crisis.501.c.edge: "You don't command us. Go away."
sofe_crisis.501.c_explain: "The Crisis will be over. The Stellarbornes will remove all Outer Gates and all celestial bodies within the Outer Clusters. All ships within the clusters will be returned to the capital systems. The Stellarbornes will remain in contact."
sofe_crisis.501.c.response: "Very well, [root.GetName]. We respect your will and determination.\n\nThis galaxy is now yours alone. Whatever gifts we have bestowed, are yours to keep. For so long as we exist, no other entities shall manipulate your galaxy ever again.\n\nGood bye, [root.GetSpeciesName]. We will remember your feats and strengths you have displayed today."
sofe_crisis.501.c.response.edge: "So be it then, [root.GetName]. Take solice in the mercy we will show you this day. We will respect and honor the sacrifices you have made during this Tournament and we will not intervene further.\n\nYou may toy with this little galaxy as you see wish. As disappointed as we are, to see such powerful empires with such shallow understandings of the universes.\n\nPerhaps we will find alternate versions of your empires that will be more...mature...more logical.\n\nWe hope that your empire will not succumb to some misfortunes that have cursed billions of civilizations that refuse to be reasonable.\n\nWe would say good bye, but that would not be honest. So get out, and do not bother us again."


sofe_crisis.501.d: "Lies! You fear our growing powers! We can surpass you!"
sofe_crisis.501.d_explain: "The Crisis is already over...it would not be wise to prolong it. Yet powers coursing through our veins, we can feel as if we can take on anything. Perhaps with the powers the Stellarbornes constantly beefing us with, we can challenge them heads-on?. Perhaps they feared we will outgrow them, and are just trying to bail out early on? Perhaps we should invade their turfs, eat them. Then we will be Lion King of the Metaverse. OOOH YEAHH? SHOULD WE DO IT?"
sofe_crisis.501.e: "Pathetic worms, your end is inevitable. Die!"
sofe_crisis.501.e_explain: "Clearly the Stellarbornes are just cowardly filths, devoid of any meaningful existences. We have destroyed all that they could muster. Their powers are nothing compared to super awesome-sauce that is our empire.\n\nWe will eat the Stellarbornes, as we are the most awesome empire in this game. We will turn into Super [root.GetSpeciesName] Blue Ultra Instinct Omen Sign Kaioken x100000 God S-Class Superheroes. Then we will transform this Shadows the Stellaarbornes kept yabbling about into a memeburger that which we will easily pummel with the power of super dimensional time stopping anime theme song. We will descend upon the foe, we shall overwhelm them, we shall LEAVE NONE ALIVE.\n\nWE FEAR NO ENEMY FOR WE ARE THE BEST GENOCIDAL EMPIRE TO HAVE EVER EXISTED IN STELLARIS...OOOOH YEAHHHH~"


sofe_crisis.501.d.response: "It seems you may be a bit too overhyped with your sudden increases in powers. As understandable as that is, we cannot accept you into the Light with this level of arrogance, not yet.\n\nPerhaps a reminder...a demonstration will be required. Consider what we are about to do as an example of what deities above the metaverses can do. Remember the horrors and pain that it will bring. It will be quick, swift and silent.\n\nThen perhaps in a new timeline you will consider your choices more carefully. That means reloading your save by the way, in case you are not catching up to this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou didn't happen to do this on Iron Man right?"
sofe_crisis.501.e.response: "You have tested our patiences for the last time.\n\nThe Hand has deemed that your existence in this universe is a mistake...Sa'lai!.\n\nVanish..."

sofe_crisis.50101.e: "§YHANDO-SAMAAAAAAAAAAAA.....!§!"
sofe_crisis.50101.explain: "Ouch, you have done it. You have pissed off the Stellarbornes enough for them to erase the galaxy. Thankfully they know this is temporary because all you have to do is to reload your save.\n\nThat is unless its Iron Man then good bye Tony Stark."
#### THE END

sofe_crisis.5001.name: "End of an Era"
sofe_crisis.5001.desc: "The Tournament of Power is over. The Stelalrbornes have recalled all of their fleets and all hostilities have ceased. It seems that someone has finally proven worthy of their expectations. But what will happens next? This is the end of an era. Nothing will ever be the same again."
sofe_crisis.5002.desc: "The Tounrmanet of Power is over. The Stelalrbornes have recalled all of their fleets and all hostilities have ceased. We have received reports that all Outer Gates have disappeared, and all connections from the Outer Cluster has been lost. We do not know what will happens next. This is the end of an era. Nothing will ever be the same again. "
sofe_crisis.5001.a: "Troubling"
sofe_crisis.5001.b: "So many questions left unanswered..."
sofe_crisis.5003.desc: "Oh boy"
sofe_crisis.5003.a: "It is over then."

sofe_crisis.9100.desc: "With a heavy heart, our leaders have come to the harsh realities...our empires have lost. The Stellarborne are simply too strong to resist for now.\n\nBut it seems all is not lost. The Stellarbornes allow us to gather strengths, assuring that we will have a second chance to compete in the contest. The question remains, will we be able to do it in time?"
sofe_crisis.9100.a: "We are outmatched."
sofe_crisis.9100.b: "This is not over..."
sofe_crisis.9100.c: "Perhaps we should just watch."

sofe_crisis.9101.desc: "It is done, the Stellarbornes have absolve us of our ancestor's sins. We are spared from the betrayal made by our past...but is the cost too high? Is this the end of our long history?\n\nOr perhaps a new beginning to a better future?"
sofe_crisis.9101.a: "There is no other way."
sofe_crisis.9101.b: "This is stupid. Sins? It was them who wronged us!"
sofe_crisis.9101.c: "Our ancestors were foolish. We must be better."

sofe_post.550.d.desc: "A moment, [root.GetRulerName]. We are in the middle of a cooking duel at the moment. Please be brief.\n\nHmm...I didn't know a black hole could be used to make Kumayaki tastier. Perhaps finally we will discover a better seasoning than hypervelocity starbreaker cannon...probably not though, a kinetic force of that level is definitely tastier than a boring Black Hole.\n\nDo you happen to have anything in your worlds that you think are delicious? Doesn't have to be food by the way. We the Stellarbornes can pretty much eat everything. There's one time we ate gravity of a planet and later all grouds on the planet, then we pour water all over the planet instead. It's ok though, there's nothing living there, in case you fear we accidently destroys life or things like that."
sofe_post.550.e.desc: "Take caution when entering the Outer Cluster. Avoid straying too far from the assigned borders. What you see, is only a portion of the great infinity that is known as the Origin Point. If you wander off outside our protections, your ships could be torn apart into pieces.

sofe_post.1.b.desc: "Very well. What secrets shall we divine today?"
sofe_post.1.c.desc: "Rightly so. We may not be able to answer all questions, but we will share what we can."

sofe_post.1.a: "What's your history exactly?"
sofe_post.1.a.response: "Our existenced dated since time immemorials, before much of the metaverse was developed. But we were not the first, we have been deliberately planted here by someone or something else. Whichever that was, it held immense powers, but there existed any traces of our creators left.\n\nOur creation was unique, we have journeyed across the universes, we never found traces of ourselves in any other pararelle universes, nor any civilizations that bore any similarities to ours. For we were born with many knowledges already within our thoughts, great powers were already ours to command. The procesas of evolutions that was the norm of every lifeforms, did not exist for us. We were simply born already perfect...in a way.\n\nImagine that your races woke up, already having the knowledges of your current era, yet knew nothing about your pasts. There was no evolution, no trace of previous history, you were simply born like you are now.\n\nWhile the curiosity of our existences at our inception existed, it was not until one of our explorers discovered an ancient being that existed outside of this metaverse. It called itself the Archseeker, and its existence and powers verified our beliefs, there were greater powers at hand, powers that far exceed what we could have imagined. Thus, the pursuit of the Great Question was borne. Our people were eager to learn of the pasts and began exploring across the cosmos.\n\nThe sudden arrival of a powerful menace, of which we called the Outsiders changed everything. These malicious entities sought to consume not just our beings, but the entire metaverse. The Outsiders struck without warning, destroyed and consumed all that was in their ways. For the first time in our history, we faced an enemy, one we must kill. It was a time of chaos, for none of us had any knowledges of war, for we never had one in our entire archives of history up until that point. But we persevered, we channeled our willpowers into what is now known as The Light. And with it, we eradicated the Outsiders down to the last. There was no trace left, it was a necessary course. Once done, we chose to limit the majority of our explorations to within this metaverse, with only the most gifted explorers being sent across the void.\n\nWe would talk more about our histories, but for now that will be suffcient."
sofe_post.1.b: "What's the languages you used during the Tournament?"
sofe_post.1.b.response: "Ah, it is actually a made-up set of words we used to sound mysterious, there's not really anything special to it. It's actually quite fun to come up with new, interesting words every new Tournaments. The truth is, we the Stellarbornes do not make use of languages at all. It is a concept that is only relevant for organisms such as yours. We are born with the knowledges to communicate with each other through our wills, and all of our powers, equipments and technologies are made to reflect such systems. Our artifacts and powers speak to us as much as we speak to them\n\nWe must say that the concept of things such as written texts and records are alien to us. And your technologies too, so many buttons. It is quite amazing that you are able to memorize so much of these trivial stuffs, given the limited memory capacity that hampered much of your progressions."
sofe_post.1.c: "What exactly is your goal?"
sofe_post.1.c.response: "Eat a lot of foo...to find and answer the Great Question. We will explain about it later when Chirumiru is not busy playing other games."
sofe_post.1.d: "You mentioned about metaverses. Can you explain?"
sofe_post.1.d.response: "Its bigger than multiverses. We will talk about it later."
sofe_post.1.e: "What is the Outer Cluster and the Gates exactly?"
sofe_post.1.e.response: "It's a gate. Sorry, we will add more later when Chirumiru decided to write about it."
