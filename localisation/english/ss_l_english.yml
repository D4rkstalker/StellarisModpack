 01_SS_AB_ASK_JOIN_A_REFUSE:0 "You will not be joining our alliance, you aren't ready to make the sacrifices. Come back when you are ready."
 
 01_SS_AB_LEAVE_A_SELECT:0 "Are you planning to leave the §Y[From.GetAllianceName]§!? Shame, I thought you were better than that."
 01_SS_AB_LEAVE_A_PROPOSE:0 "I have decided to leave this alliance. It is only holding me back."
 01_SS_AB_LEAVE_A_ACCEPT:0 "A shame; a wasted opportunity, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Go you own way and find peace in your last days."
 
 01_SS_AB_DEMAND_VASS_SELECT:0 "You want me to cede my authority to you?"
 02_SS_AB_DEMAND_VASS_SELECT:0 "Petulant child; foolish deals only delays the great plan."
 01_SS_AB_DEMAND_VASS_PROPOSE:0 "I have decided that your agency is best revoked. Cede to my authority for all our sake."
 01_SS_AB_DEMAND_VASS_ACCEPT:0 "This is best... For now."
 01_SS_AB_DEMAND_VASS_REFUSE:0 "Our goals are incompatible; our paths diverge. I cannot accept this arangement."
 02_SS_AB_DEMAND_VASS_REFUSE:0 "You have lost your minds if you think we would accept. Go and reconsider your usefulness."
 
 01_SS_AB_ASK_FOR_VASS_PROPOSE:0 "I... The plan is in danger. Please, support us while I gather my strength. Will you guarantee our security?"
 
 SS_AB_ASK_FOR_SUBS_PROPOSE_01:0 "I wish to enter this... bizarre arangement for now."
 
 01_SS_AB_RELEASE_SUBJECT_SELECT:0 "I will have to make my own path, as I have for aeons."
 01_SS_AB_RELEASE_SUBJECT_PROPOSE:0 "You have lost sight of our shared goals. You will have to find your own path."

 01_SS_AB_MAKE_RIVAL_NEUTRAL:0 "You decide to oppose me? You will waste to nothingness, one way or the other."
 01_SS_AB_MAKE_RIVAL_HOSTILE:0 "At least you choose to stand for your foolish stance. You have no place in the universe now, or forever more."
 
 01_SS_AB_MAKE_RIVAL_PROPOSE:0 "I have grown tired of you. It's time I made an example of you."
 01_SS_AB_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "What a shame. I hoped you would be more."
 01_SS_AB_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Then stand your defences and embolden your will, you will be excluded from the plan."
 01_SS_AB_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Yes. Bring yourself closer to me, you will die and your screaming souls will be mine; forever. I will enjoy this."
 
 01_SS_AB_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "Yes, there is no need for continued hostility; we both follow the same path."
 01_SS_AB_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "You finally see the clearer view? The future is known by both of us. Let us work together."
 01_SS_AB_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "I no longer have the patience to pay attention to your pitiful and meaningless people."
 
 01_SS_AB_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Excellent, let us reforge our common understanding."
 01_SS_AB_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Now we shall turn our attention to the task ahead of us, rather than meaningless hostility."
 01_SS_AB_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Fascinating. Maybe now you see the consequences of you actions. However, you redemption has long since passed, [From.GetSpeciesName]"

 01_SS_AB_INTEGRATE_NEUTRAL:0 "Go on."
 01_SS_AB_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "What an interesting, but completely stupid proposal."
 01_SS_AB_INTEGRATE_PROPOSE:0 "Join us in the great plan, [Root.GetSpeciesName]"
 
 01_SS_AB_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Maybe you can follow through the plan yourself. I underestimated this galaxy. Please, don't lose sight of the dark future."
 01_SS_AB_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "So, I have failed. I go out with a wimper, rather than a bang. The future is clouded and once again... I fear for it."
 01_SS_AB_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "You have doomed everyone, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. All will be dark and the last intelligence of the universe, will whisper your name with vile discontent. You are all that is evil. I should have consumed you while I had the chance."
 
 01_SS_AB_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_FRIENDLY:0 "You hand the reigns back to me? Maybe my destiny goes futher yet."
 01_SS_AB_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_NEUTRAL:0 "Yes, let me get back to the work, there is still hope."
 01_SS_AB_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "Amazing. Know that while I live, I am a threat you."

 01_SS_AB_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "And so the war shall continue."
 01_SS_AB_CANCEL_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "How foolish. I won't give you mercy as you have done."
 
 01_SS_AB_FORM_DP_ACCEPT:0 "This arangement will suit us until the plan is ready."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_DP_REFUSE:0 "This is not appropriate. There is nothing worth defending."
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_DP_ACCEPT:0 "So be it."
 
 01_SS_AB_FORM_NAP_SELECT:0 "You wish to forge a peaceful path with me?"
 01_SS_AB_FORM_NAP_PROPOSE:0 "Our goals, our destiny is the same, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. It would be better if we formalised an understanding..."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_NAP_ACCEPT:0 "Conflict between us only slows down the great plan and brings the end closer. Peace serves us well."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_NAP_REFUSE:0 "Peace is a luxury we can't afford."
 
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_NAP_SELECT:0 "You better know your own path."
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_NAP_PROPOSE:0 "This agreement hinders our progress."
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_NAP_ACCEPT:0 "Then I shall have no qualms with future conflict with you kind."
 
 01_SS_AB_GUARANTEE_SELECT:0 "So the [From.GetName] is prepared to vouch for my continued sovereignty?"
 01_SS_AB_GUARANTEE_PROPOSE:0 "Your independance is of use to me. I shall support it."

 01_SS_AB_SUPPORT_INDEPENDENCE_SELECT_DISLOYAL:0 "Please, free me from this prison, there is much I must work on."
 01_SS_AB_SUPPORT_INDEPENDENCE_PROPOSE:0 "You serve me better as independent. I will relinquish you from your ties."
 01_SS_AB_SUPPORT_INDEPENDENCE_ACCEPT_LOYAL:0 "I am not interesting in your diplomatic pandering."

 01_SS_AB_REVOKE_INDEPENDENCE_PROPOSE:0 "Your independence is no longer of my interest."
 01_SS_AB_REVOKE_INDEPENDENCE_ACCEPT_LOYAL:0 "Finally, you break off the foolish guarantee."
 01_SS_AB_REVOKE_INDEPENDENCE_ACCEPT_DISLOYAL:0 "Most unfortunate."
 
 01_SS_AB_FORM_MIGRATION_PACT_PROPOSE:0 "Our peoples would best be ready for the coming challenge with free migration between our territories. I propose an arangement..."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_MIGRATION_PACT_ACCEPT:0 "This will serve me well."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_MIGRATION_PACT_REFUSE:0 "It is best if your people have nothing to do with ours."
 
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_MIGRATION_PACT_SELECT:0 "You wish to break the existing travel arangement?"
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_MIGRATION_PACT_PROPOSE:0 "This travel arangement has proved to work against me. I am severing the deal."
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_MIGRATION_PACT_ACCEPT:0 "So be it."
 
 01_SS_AB_OPEN_BORDERS_SELECT:0 "You wish to open you borders to me?"
 01_SS_AB_OPEN_BORDERS_PROPOSE:0 "Dark clouds gather. There is a challenge ahead of us, open borders would suit us both."
 01_SS_AB_OPEN_BORDERS_ACCEPT:0 "This gesture will serve the plan well."
 
 01_SS_AB_CLOSE_BORDERS_SELECT:0 "You wish to close your borders to me?"
 01_SS_AB_CLOSE_BORDERS_PROPOSE:0 "The current border arangements are hindering me. I wish to close them to you."

 01_SS_AB_KICK_FROM_ALLIANCE_SELECT:0 "Would you exclude me from the [Root.GetAllianceName]?"
 01_SS_AB_KICK_FROM_ALLIANCE_PROPOSE:0 "Our paths no longer align. Sign the song of the end days by yourself."
 01_SS_AB_KICK_FROM_ALLIANCE_ACCEPT:0 "Deeply unsettling. I though the galaxy would unite in common purpose. As before, I shall complete the plan alone."

 01_SS_AB_DEMAND_TRIBUTARY_ACCEPT:0 "This is probably the best arrangement given my current position."
 01_SS_AB_DEMAND_TRIBUTARY_REFUSE:1 "I do not tolerate extortion. I have other matters to be concerned about."
 
 01_SS_AB_ASK_BECOME_TRIBUTARY_SELECT:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] wish to pay me tribute?"
 01_SS_AB_ASK_BECOME_TRIBUTARY_PROPOSE:0 "I seek an arangement for my security, please consider it."

 01_SS_AB_ASK_BECOME_TRIBUTARY_REFUSE:0 "Keep your resources for yourself. I have no interest in them."
 
 01_SS_AB_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Whatever primordial slime or malfunctioning assembly line spewed you forth did so with revulsion. You are the deplorable undercurrent of intelligence, worthy of nothing but spite and discontent. Never foul my presence again."
 02_SS_AB_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "In my prison, I observed all manner of wonderful life forms that fill this galaxy; however I have overlooked you. I must have assumed you to be a lowly bacterium, given your total level of intelligence."
 03_SS_AB_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "By all means, don't let me stop you. Any moment now you do something stupid and destroy yourselves in some cataclysm. That would be a relief, then I wouldn't have to painfully remind myself that you somehow exist."
 
 01_SS_AB_INSULT_ACCEPT:0 "Curious. You think words will halt your inevitable end."
 02_SS_AB_INSULT_ACCEPT:0 "Keep barking; I hear thee not."

 01_SS_AB_BREAK_COMMERCIAL_PACT_SELECT:0 "You wish to severe our trade agreement?"
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_COMMERCIAL_PACT_PROPOSE:0 "This agreement is not longer tenable. I am halting the deal."
 01_SS_AB_BREAK_COMMERCIAL_PACT_ACCEPT:0 "This will not delay the great plan."
 
 01_SS_AB_FORM_RESEARCH_AGREEMENT_PROPOSE:0 "There is much even you can teach me, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Let us engage in a mutual research agreement."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_RESEARCH_AGREEMENT_ACCEPT:0 "This will benefit both of us, I accept."
 01_SS_AB_FORM_RESEARCH_AGREEMENT_REFUSE:0 "I have too many secrets that aren't worthy of learning. I cannot accept."
 
 01_SS_AB_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "This will bring you closer to me. Excellent, together there is nothing that can stop us."
 01_SS_AB_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "You seek to learn my ways? Let us speak."
 01_SS_AB_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "I don't see much reason there is to talk with each other."
 
 01_SS_AB_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "I am heartened to learn that you accept me."
 01_SS_AB_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Good; let me tell you of the great plan."
 01_SS_AB_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "You have much to say to redeem yourself. Speak."
 
 01_SS_AB_RECALL_EMBASSY_FRIENDLY:0 "A break in this relationship is required."
 01_SS_AB_RECALL_EMBASSY_NEUTRAL:0 "You have demonstrated you are not ready. Come back to me later."
 01_SS_AB_RECALL_EMBASSY_HOSTILE:0 "Go know, I wish to hear you no longer."
 
 01_SS_AB_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Curious. Why? I thought we understood each other."
 01_SS_AB_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Maybe you aren't ready to make the sacrifices."
 01_SS_AB_RECALL_EMBASSY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "As I thought. You are no less deplorable then you were before."
