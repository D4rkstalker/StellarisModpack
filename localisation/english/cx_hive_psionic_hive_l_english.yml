Until recently, these cases were just disregarded or misunderstood.\n\nNow, however, our brain drones have finally obtained conclusive evidence that proves the psionic potential inherent in certain [Root.GetSpeciesName] drones. Although only a very small minority of our species as a whole seems to be gifted with psionic powers, their numbers relative to the total population have grown steadily over just the last few centuries.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of sudden evolutionary growth-spurt or because something has triggered latent psionic abilities that were always present in our genetic code, brain drones cannot say.\n\nThese new powers allow us to exist without the need of any physical form and invade the minds of lesser beings, assimilating them into the collective."

It is as if some sort of communal pool of [Root.GetSpeciesName] psychic energy finally reached a critical tipping point, collectively awakening the latent abilities of our brains.\n\nWe are now tied with the universe in a way we could have ever imagined, looking at this new realm to communicate with."

 psionic_hive.2655.desc:0 "Like a muffled whisper in a dark room, the Shroud calls to us from within our mind. It is a primordial realm of pure psychic energy that came into being at the dawn of time. All creatures that have been gifted with psionic abilities tap into the Shroud in some way to draw power, even if only subconsciously.\n\nSince our transcendence, we have begun to see the Shroud with greater clarity. There are patterns where once even our strongest synapse drones could see only a formless mass of swirling energy. There are... other things, as well. Spirits of a sort, that gaze back on us from the other side. Sometimes with curiousity, sometimes with kindness... and sometimes with malice.\n\nWe are still in the process of learning the extent of our new powers, but it may be possible for us to commune with these spirits. It will require the combined efforts of our most powerful synaptic drones."
 psionic_hive.2656.desc:0 "After days of being locked in an hypnotic trance, our synaptic drones in the collective have finally managed to open a gateway into the Shroud. The use of Zro allowed our collective to finally breach the mind barrier, proving it to be a valuable resource in the eons to come.\n\nNow that we have established an initial psionic link, our mind will start growing and expanding our domain in this realm and the Shroud!"
