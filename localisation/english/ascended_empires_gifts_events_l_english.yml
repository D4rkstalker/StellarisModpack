 ascended_empires_gifts.2.desc.spiritualist:0 "We have recently retired a number of obsolete warships from our vast fleet that was due for decommission or to be turned into attractions or museums. However, they may serve a greater purpose should we decide to bestow them as gifts to our loyal subjects. Only the most faithful deserve our reward, and they will help us exact punishment to all unbelievers in the galaxy. We should consider if the §H[NoobEmpire.GetName]§! is a worthy recipient of this generous gift. Our scientists advised we may have to remove a number of more advanced components, so the §H[NoobEmpire.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! are not overly confused by their operation. These will be replaced by cruder devices with fewer buttons and operational stages, and modified to include other quality-of-life features, allowing easier handling by pilots with sub-optimal shape. We may also have to install anti-tinkering devices too, so as to prevent §H[NoobEmpire.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! from accidently causing the ship to explode."
