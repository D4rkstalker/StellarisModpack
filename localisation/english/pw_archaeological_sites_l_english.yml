    ## Archaeology: Drained Paradise.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_drained_paradise: "Drained Paradise"
    pw_site_drained_paradise_desc: "Readings suggest that [From.Planet.GetName] was habitable at some point in its history. Not only that, the composition of the ground, orbital position and presence of water show that the planet could have had a thriving ecosystem, lush green fields, abundance of minerals and a paradisiacal atmosphere. What could have happened to deprive this planet of life?\n\nThere are many signals of ruined buildings also present in the surface, three of which draw the most attention because of their size and key position. Maybe they hold the secret of this planet's past."
    #Stage 1 - Demetrius Cornucopia
    pw_archaeology.105.name: "Empty Cornucopia"
    pw_archaeology.105.desc: "The first of these grand ruins consist of an abandoned genetic laboratory isolated from other ruins. Surrounding soil readings suggest a great diversity of nutrients used to compose the ground here and points to a planet containing a myriad of environments that housed diverse plant, animal and fungi life.\nOne of the better preserved walls of the building revel the drawing of a cornucopia, and it seems that this was food growing and collection center in a distant past. Further analysis shows that this was the epicenter of total ecological collapse of the planet's biosphere, due to predatory harvesting practices."
    #Stage 2 - Helios Tower
    pw_archaeology.110.name: "Exhausted Tower"
    pw_archaeology.110.desc: "The second ruined location appears to be a grand solar structure of some sort, that used to consist of a heliostat with several mirror arrays pointing to a central spire that converted the captured solar energy to another form, which we could not determine. The entire structure seem to have been able to float freely following the star's zenith to maximize energy intake, but has crashed a long time ago from lack of maintenance.\nIn proximity to the crash site, our archeologists have found the control facility of this wonderful structure, which contains records telling how the original builders were able to manipulate the atmosphere of [From.Planet.GetName], to clear the clouds for the heliostat and exploit the rain in hydropower reservoirs. The constant seeding and voiding of clouds has shredded the atmosphere of the planet to the point of catastrophe."
    #Stage 3 - Erebus Project
    pw_archaeology.115.name: "Drained Rock"
    pw_archaeology.115.desc: "The third ruin is the entrance of a gigantic mining project that permeates the entire surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Old machinery and tools here indicate a massive scale prospecting and extraction enterprise of valuable minerals of many types and uses. Unfortunately, the archaeological team also found several reports of soil erosion and land degradation caused by this excavation, and evidence that those reports were solemnly ignored; the final nail on this planets coffin.\n\nAll is not lost, however, with the data we have collected from these sites, and the employment of our own technology and resources, the science team here is fairly confident that they can bring this planet back to its verdant glory, using the established infrastructure. First we must revert the erosion processes and bring nutrients back to the ground by utilizing our own minerals.\n\n§RWe require 1500 £minerals£ §Y$minerals$§! to continue with the terraforming process.§!"
    pw_archaeology.115.a: "Use the minerals, start the renewal process."
    #Stage 4 - Fixed planet surface
    pw_archaeology.120.name: "A Ground to Walk Upon"
    pw_archaeology.120.desc: "By adapting some of the old digging machines of the mining project we could rebuild the soil components and mend the earth, bringing tectonic stability and mineral nutrition back to most of the surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Care was taken to retain some of these extracting facilities for future use, provided we do not drain the minerals from the planet once again. This paves the way to revitalizing the biosphere, but is only the first step.\n\nNow the science team gaze upwards, to the atmosphere, for we must use our energy to reestablish the original gasses and jump start the water cycle.\n\n§RWe require 1500 £energy£ §Y$energy$§! to continue with the terraforming process.§!"
    #Stage 5 - Fixed planet atmosphere
    pw_archaeology.125.name: "A Sky Over Our Heads"
    pw_archaeology.125.desc: "Utilizing the ancient cloud manipulation facility of the heliostat, the science tem in [From.Planet.GetName] was able to revert its damaging process and refill the atmosphere with gases that will help with the settlement of life in the planet. While not entirely breathable, the newly established atmosphere is already balancing the planet temperature, protecting the surface from space radiation and waiting to receive gas exchange from life forms.\n\nThe terraforming process is almost complete, now we only need to reintroduce a stable ecosystem to harmonious maintain the achieved planetary balance.\n\n§RWe require 1500 £food£ §Y$food$§! to continue with the terraforming process.§!"
    pw_archaeology.125.a: "We will provide the nutrients to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.125.b: "We will provide the resources to finish the process."
    #Stage 6 - Fixed planet ecosphere and restored Gaia
    pw_archaeology.130.name: "Life All Around"
    pw_archaeology.130.desc: "Using the provided resources and the facilities in the abandoned cornucopia the science team has manage to revitalize the broken biosphere of [From.Planet.GetName] and reignite the vital force there. By using recovered data, we could stabilize gas exchange and food chains much faster than natural phenomenons. Finally, our scientists could breath the fresh air of the planet for the first time.\n\n[From.Planet.GetName] now blossoms with new life and proper colonization of the planet can be underway. The only caveat is that the ecosystem of the planet - the soil, the atmosphere and the living organisms - is in an unstable balance and can never recover completely, thus the ancient structures that drained the planetary living energy cannot be rebuild, but they can still serve us as they are."

    ## Archaeology: Lunar Archive.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_lunar_archive: "Lunar Archive"
    pw_site_lunar_archive_desc: "There is considerable evidence of alien activity inside this moon.\n\nInitial reports suggest that this natural satellite was completely excavated and an extensive structure of unknown purpose was constructed inside. The science team speculates that this lunar complex was build by the inhabitants of the orbiting planet with advanced techniques, but could not discern its function."
    #Stage 1 - Particle Museum
    pw_archaeology.205.name: "Museum of Particles"
    pw_archaeology.205.desc: "Gaining entrance into the lunar complex was a relatively easy task, it seams that the structure was designed to be accessible and inviting. Inside, the archaeology team quickly noticed that the complex is divided in distinct sections, designated as collections and began exploring one of these chambers.\n\nThe first collection the team found presented itself as \"The Assemblage of Every Known Particle\", of which only vestiges remain. However, evidence found does suggest some great technological and power investment in maintaining a diverse collection of particles stable and in display, alongside heaps of experimental data on this field of physics. If these are to be believed, this civilization was able to maintain in stasis some elements we could only observe in the birth of stars!"
    #Stage 2 - Library of Babel
    pw_archaeology.210.name: "Library of Babel"
    pw_archaeology.210.desc: "The second collection housed in this lunar complex reveled a deep preoccupation with history and the preservation of knowledge shared by the civilization that constructed this place. It consist in a repository of non-digital data, such as alien books, maps, sound and image recordings and physical models of every kind. The collection spans several floors and will require a permanent research station in order analyze everything.\n\nWhile it is unclear if this collection served as a simple preservation of the past, or an active source of historiographical studies, it has become evident that there is a lot here to help us understand this ancient culture."
    #Stage 3 - Mechanist Collection
    pw_archaeology.215.name: "Mechanical Collection"
    pw_archaeology.215.desc: "As the team reaches the third collection, the purpose of this whole complex becomes more apparent. Seemingly, the moon was converted into a repository of information indistinct of area of knowledge, that was able to hold everything that civilization would produce or research.\n\nThe collection in question seems to have been constructed to hold every kind engineering model conceived, from the most simple to the utterly complex. Data from this assortment is already being transferred to our researchers in order to compare with our own mechanical evolution. While there are many insights we can draw from these designs, it is no surprise that such an advanced technology was required to construct a place like this."
    #Stage 4 - Cradle Initiative
    pw_archaeology.220.name: "Cradle of Worlds"
    pw_archaeology.220.desc: "The team investigating what is now known as The Lunar Archive, has come across the caveats of such a bold project: maintenance. It seems that centuries without the caretaking of diligent archivists have render most of the collections fruitless.\n\nAfter investigating many empty chambers, the archaeology team had exciting news about their findings: a collection of habitable planets. At least, what is left of an assortment of models detailing habitable conditions in galactic bodies. Most of the models have crumbled to dust, but one drew special interest: it is an almost perfect match to a planet in this system we have deemed uninhabitable. Our scientists are already reviewing the data, but it seems that the planet indeed held life at some point in its history, and more importantly, we may have the key to reviving it once again."
    #Stage 5 - Holoarchive
    pw_archaeology.225.name: "The Archive of Archives"
    pw_archaeology.225.desc: "Finally, the excavating team has reached the operational center of the Lunar Archive. They have found a marvel of documentation, an Archive of Archives. This center acts as the index of all the other collections, utilizing a surprisingly intuitive organization system, and remains the most preserved chamber of the complex.\n\nHere a permanent research station can be established, aiding any ongoing research on the orbiting planet. And, as it was designed, the Lunar Archive shall be open for all scholars who wish to research the vast repository of knowledge it provides."
    #After 30~60 days: add the tech
    pw_archaeology.230.name: "A Grand Archive"
    pw_archaeology.230.desc: "After the recent excavation of the Lunar Archive, our intellectual circles have been discussing the possibility of organizing such project for own culture: a place where we can catalogue and analyze our history, without immaterial speculation.\n\nAfter all, We have gathered many of the techniques that could be employed in this enterprise. We would simply have to collect the contents of this massive archive."
    pw_archaeology.230.a: "A logical project for our future."
    pw_archaeology.230.b: "Our research requires no such gimmicks."

    ## Archaeology: Living Reliquary.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_living_reliquary: "Living Reliquary"
    pw_site_living_reliquary_desc: "Upon one of the rocks drifting along this asteroid field, lies a titanic skeleton of some long-dead voidborn creature, similar in appearance to descriptions of the fabled Ether Drake. The carcass itself would make excellent archaeologic material, but readings also show signs of artificial constructions among the remains."
    #Stage 1 - Leviathan Description
    pw_archaeology.305.name: "Bal'Fu Pilgrims"
    pw_archaeology.305.desc: "In a primary exploration of the titanic remains found drifting along the asteroid field, the archaeological team found scraps of several personal goods, such as clothing, jewelry and furniture. The objects seem to be arranged for use, as if some group employed the corpse of this Leviathan as shelter, after its demise.\n\nA closer look on surviving records of these inhabitants shows us that they called themselves \"The Bal'Fu Pilgrims\" and that they placed significant spiritual value on the dead creature.\n\nThere are no apparent signs to suggest a cause of death for this space Leviathan."
    #Stage 2 - Codex of the Ages
    pw_archaeology.310.name: "Codex of the Ages"
    pw_archaeology.310.desc: "Further exploration of the life inside this titanic beast shows that the Bal'Fu Pilgrims not only considered this ancient creature divine, but were very spiritual in general. There are pedestals for many of their holy relics all around the insides of the Leviathan, but very few still remain.\n\nOur archaeological team has manage to recover what is left of one of these relics: a worn leather-bound ancient codex with most of its pages missing. According to the inscriptions found on the pedestal, the Pilgrims believed this book held a description of everything that was and everything that will be.\n\nLead archeologist §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes that examination of the book could yield good results, but warns us that, according to legends, it must be done with purpose: either looking for the future or looking for the past."
    pw_archaeology.310.a: "Verify what the Codex says about the past."
    pw_archaeology.310.b: "Peek at what the Codex tells of the future."
    pw_archaeology.310.c: "We have no time for spiritual nonsense, analyse it properly."
    #Stage 2 (option 1) - Knowledge of past ages
    pw_archaeology.311.name: "Codex of Past Ages"
    pw_archaeology.311.desc: "As §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carefully decipher fragments of the Codex found in the titanic reliquary, left behind by the Bal'Fu, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] starts to apply the teachings of the ages to [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] work. The crew reports many helpful insights while conducting analyses."
    pw_archaeology.311.a: "There is knowledge to learn from the past."
    #Stage 2 (option 2) - Knowledge of future ages
    pw_archaeology.312.name: "Codex of Future Ages"
    pw_archaeology.312.desc: "As §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carefully decipher fragments of the Codex found in the titanic reliquary, left behind by the Bal'Fu, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] contacts some of [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] colleagues occupied with research in other fields. While skeptical at first, our research leaders confirm that, with the information [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] shared with them, they can conduct innovative experiments in their ares, unlocking new paths for our advancement."
    pw_archaeology.312.a: "So this is what the future was holding for us."
    #Stage 2 (option 3 random) - Only unity
    pw_archaeology.313.name: "Codex of Lost Ages"
    pw_archaeology.313.desc: "As §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carefully decipher texts of the Codex found in the titanic reliquary, left behind by the Bal'Fu, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] realizes that the remaining fragments are not enoughs to make sense of the texts. Unfortunately, we can never know what knowledge this ancient book held in its time."
    pw_archaeology.313.a: "At least we can have a glimpse of their traditions."
    #Stage 3 - Stargazing Mirror
    pw_archaeology.315.name: "Stargazing Mirror"
    pw_archaeology.315.desc: "The archaeological team investigating the ancient Bal'Fu has found another of their surviving relics: a cracked metal bowl that used to aid astronomers by reflecting the stars. Ancient records describe how the Bal'Fu used this Stargazing Mirror to search for self enlightenment, until one of their prophets received a vision of the Leviathan in the mirror, which caused them to scour the galaxy in search of this promised saviour.\n\nWhile heavily damaged, science officer §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! speculates that a ritual to gaze into the mirror can be performed as the records describe. However, once again, legends states that looking into the mirror must be done with purpose: \"One must be searching for answers inside or searching for salvation outside\". Whatever that means."
    pw_archaeology.315.a: "Attempt to search... inside?"
    pw_archaeology.315.b: "...Look for answers outside?"
    pw_archaeology.315.c: "Don't waste time, simply catalogue the findings."
    #Stage 3 (option 1) - Introspective Gaze
    pw_archaeology.316.name: "Introspective Gaze"
    pw_archaeology.316.desc: "By looking through the Stargazing Mirror, the science team excavating the remains of the fallen Leviathan could better understand the cultural rituals the ancient Bal'Fu used in search of self enlightenment."
    pw_archaeology.316.a: "An interesting reflection of the past."
    #Stage 3 (option 2) - Extrospective Gaze
    pw_archaeology.317.name: "Extrospective Gaze"
    pw_archaeology.317.desc: "Study of the Stargazing Mirror by the science team excavating the remains of the fallen Leviathan has given the science team valuable insights on political manipulation, specially directed to establishing a presence in space. There is still doubt regarding the origin of this knowledge, but our empire can certainly reap its benefits"
    pw_archaeology.317.a: "Look forward and outward."
    #Stage 4 - Heart of the Leviathan
    pw_archaeology.320.name: "Heart of the Leviathan"
    pw_archaeology.320.desc: "Finally, the archaeological team has reached the center of the fallen Leviathan, where they have determined that the heart of the creature should be. And it is still here!\n\nSurrounded by the skeletal remains of the Bal'Fu, a dark reflective irregular rock sits at the center of the thoracic cavity of the titanic beast. The corpses are the first specimens of the Bal'Fu we have encountered and they seem to have congregated here at the time of their deaths. In fact, new analyses show that both the Pilgrims and the Leviathan perished at about the same time, which points to a new hypothesis that the Bal'Fu lived inside the Leviathan while it was still alive!\n\nReadings show strange energy emissions coming the heart of the Leviathan, we can respect the ancient traditions of the Bal'Fu Pilgrims and maintain the heart here, studying the remains of their conclave or take the heart to be analyzed in our labs."
    pw_archaeology.320.a: "Preserve the Heart here for study and pilgrimage."
    pw_archaeology.320.b: "Take the Heart to a laboratory for study."
    #After 30~60 days: add the tech
    pw_archaeology.330.name: "A Reliquary of Our Own"
    pw_archaeology.330.desc: "After the recent excavation of the Living Reliquary, our theologians and scholars have been discussing the possibility of organizing such project for own faith: a place where we can sanctify the relics of our past that define our culture, much like the ones found inside the dead Leviathan.\n\nWhile the prospect of finding a void creature to house our artifacts is amusing, we should construct a building for that task. Specially if that building is to be a wonder to behold."
    pw_archaeology.330.a: "A blessed project for our future."
    pw_archaeology.330.b: "Our faith requires no such gimmicks."

    ## Archaeology: Translunar Network.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_translunar_network: "Translunar Archive"
    pw_site_translunar_network_desc: "This moon shows signs of civilization and culture, but readings confirm that there is no evidence that it was habitable at any point in time. Maybe there are secrets to life that we are yet to discover?"
    #Stage 1 - Tunnel Entrance
    pw_archaeology.405.name: "Crater Entrance"
    pw_archaeology.405.desc: "The archaeological team was surprised to find entrances in many of the craters of this moon that did not show up in preliminary readings. They lead to an expansive tunnel complex that seems to connect much of the surface of the moon in a logistic network. Tools and equipment found suggest that the network of tunnels served both as a mining project and as a channel of distribution.\n\nThere are still no indication that the moon supported life at any point, but the presence of some type of civilization maintains suspicion. Maybe the answers lies deeper."
    #Stage 2 - Species Analysis
    pw_archaeology.410.name: "Specimen Analysis"
    pw_archaeology.410.desc: "While exploring further the depths of this moon, the archaeological team found several conserved remains of its former inhabitants. They appear to have been a lithoid species that subsisted on the excavated minerals found here, giving the tunnels another purpose. Further analysis shows that they were not native to this moon and that minerals here were not as nutritional to them as they were used to. Culturally, they seem to have had collectivist tendencies, as there are sings that the tunnels were designed to provide the entire satellite with the needed sustenance and scarce comforts they could spare."
    #Stage 3 - Living Spaces
    pw_archaeology.415.name: "Living Caverns"
    pw_archaeology.415.desc: "Many underground galleries were found while exploring the tunnel network. While most appear to have been excavated in search of minerals, some of them seem to have been used as living space. The presence of a diverse array of tools and equipment indicate advanced cultural production - even with a harsh life in a barren rock, the lithoid species never gave up on their artistic endeavors and expression.\n\nAnalysis of surviving records indicate that this species called themselves \"Rukkir\" and that the community established here were the survivors of a great purge, promulgated by a foreign empire. In fact, our researchers speculate that this may have been the last group of Rukkir in the entire galaxy!"
    pw_archaeology.415.a: "Keep digging!"
    #Stage 4 - Storage Area
    pw_archaeology.420.name: "Stone Storage"
    pw_archaeology.420.desc: "More underground caves found withing the rukkirian complex of tunnels yielded interesting results. The archaeological team found several chambers dedicated to the storage and distribution of minerals and other products consumed by the the Rukkir. These chambers and the connecting tunnels form an elegant logistic system that guaranteed that every member of this community could provide what they were able, while satisfying their needs as best as possible, with no regards for hierarchical positions. It is the common opinion among the excavating team that the Rukkir would not have survived for as long as they did, if it were not for their strong sense of community and care for each of their members.\n\nThe team also discovered that the Rukkir were able to escape detection from their assailants by utilizing the properties of rare crystals in this moon to confuse sensors and avoid their complete genocide."
    #Stage 5 - Demise
    pw_archaeology.425.name: "The Final Stand"
    pw_archaeology.425.desc: "The last evidence the archaeological team could find on the Rukkir shows that their plan of diversion did not work forever, and they were ultimately discovered and decimated by their great enemy. It seems that the technological advancements of this genocidal empire were too fast and they could pierce the crystalline distortion by using different sensory techniques.\n\nEven with the species disappearance, the work the Rukkir left behind does not need to be wasted, as there are still many extracted minerals, crystals and motes here. Our own species could benefit from the constructed facilities here."
    #After 30~60 days: add the tech
    pw_archaeology.430.name: "A Planetary Tunnel System"
    pw_archaeology.430.desc: "The recent excavation of the last home of the Rukkir and examination of their life style and social organization has piqued the interest of many community leaders in our empire. There are many movements pushing for the establishment of similar distribution systems in our own planets, should the technology allow.\n\nThis would be indeed the perfect way to guarantee that most, if not all, the needs of our population are met equally."
    pw_archaeology.430.a: "All shall benefit from this research."
    pw_archaeology.430.b: "Our community has no need for this."

    ## Archaeology: Forgotten Reliquary.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_forgotten_reliquary: "Forgotten Reliquary"
    pw_site_forgotten_reliquary_desc: "The ruins of an ancient structure lied hidden until we uncovered their remains. They predate the colonization of this planet and many strange markings and symbols cover its surface.\n\nSuch a mystery that fortune has brought us."
    #Stage 0 - Discovered site after block clear
    pw_archaeology.501.name: "Forgotten Reliquary"
    pw_archaeology.501.desc: "The crew clearing the land of [THIS.GetName] has made a breathtaking discovery - hidden in plain sight among the planetary features they found ancient ruins of unknown origin, dating from before our presence on this planet. So far, their excavation has revealed remnants of an ancient structure, almost completely covered in strange symbols and markings. Our scientists are already eager to examine these ruins and have requested the establishment of a proper archeological site to begin their expeditions."
    pw_archaeology.501.a: "How fortunate! Let us start digging!"
    pw_archaeology.501.b: "We have nothing to learn from the past."
    # Stage 1 - Entrance + Reliquary
    pw_archaeology.505.name: "Reliquary Entrance"
    pw_archaeology.505.desc: "Fortunately, the crew that removed the planetary features around the entrance of these ruins worked with care to not disturb the historical artifacts. An entrance leading to a tunnel was discovered, it continues downward into the underground and, even with evidence that the whole building predates our colonization of the planet, the construction bellow seems to remain relatively well preserved. Although much of the structure on the surface was eroded by time, many of the symbols carved on it have survived.\n\nWith a preliminary analysis, our team speculates that this place worked as both some form of spiritual center and some kind of vault. The team will start exploring the underground to see what secrets can be uncovered."
    # Stage 2 - Signet Ring
    pw_archaeology.510.name: "Diplomatic Seal"
    pw_archaeology.510.desc: "To the surprise of our archaeological team, the interior of the underground facility is not as conserved as the entrance might have suggested. The main and only corridor extends downwards with doors leadings to many chambers on each side. While the corridor itself is well preserved, most of the rooms are collapsed, in ruins or, in some cases, completely empty. So far no cause was found that could explain the dissonance between the states of the many chambers.\n\nThe fist fruitful room our team has encountered seems to be some mixture of shrine and vault to an artifact named \"The Signet Ring\", described as having conciliatory powers and as a mark of the diplomatic history of the people that built this place. While the artifact itself appears to be missing from its coffer, there is much to learn from the preserved documents that fill the chamber - both about their society and on how to apply their diplomatic knowledge."
    pw_archaeology.510.a: "Our envoys will greatly benefit form this knowledge."
    pw_archaeology.510.b: "Signs of an inspiring civilization."
    pw_archaeology.510.c: "There is little our diplomats can lear by now."
    pw_archaeology.510.d: "Diplomacy is for the weak!"
    # Stage 3 - Scepter of the Solar Regent
    pw_archaeology.515.name: "Regal Scepter"
    pw_archaeology.515.desc: "Further exploration of the facility revealed more and more dilapidated rooms. Our team is convinced that there must be a deliberate cause to the patterns of disarray the chambers are in, since no natural phenomena fits as an explanation. It is as if the devotees of this shrine destroyed each room following some designation, maybe they thought they were following the whims of fate or the steps of some pre conceived plan.\n\nFortunately, our team found a new room opened to exploration further down the corridor. Each chamber on this location was at some point dedicated to an artifact of holy prestige to this culture, and this one was designated to the \"Solar Scepter\", as it was called. Once again, there is no trace of the artifact itself, but its complete legend is described here: a tale of power and authority, revolution and liberty. It is most informative for aspiring statists."
    # Stage 4 - Coin of Fortune (Final)
    pw_archaeology.520.name: "Fortuitous Discoveries"
    pw_archaeology.520.desc: "The final room, located at the very end of the main corridor, is the last one that can still provide answers about this place.\n\nThis main chamber is dedicated to housing an artifact named \"The Coin of Fortune\" and its legends. Constructed in a central location, the rest of the temple branches from this place towards the surface and indicates that the builders held a particular devotion towards the workings of Luck - or Fate, or Fortune, as the translations vary. In fact, it is confirmed that the devotees of this reliquary have destroyed each of the other vaults themselves, following arcane predictions of diviners and soothsayers that studied the Coin.\n\nFortunately for us, the chamber is completely intact and the very Coin of Fortune still rests upon its pedestal! The many engravings that cover the walls speak of its mystic power: with a simple flip it can stir the course of events in the universe towards a different destiny. The legitimacy of these powers is heavily debated among the archaeologists, but perhaps it should remain a matter of faith. Either way, it is a revered relic that should be in our custody.\n\nAnd a valuable asset if we dare to flip it."
    pw_archaeology.520.a: "The Coin is safer with us."
    pw_archaeology.520.b: "Leave it there, it is nothing but bad omens."

    ## Archaeology: Hidden Factory.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_hidden_factory: "Hidden Factory"
    pw_site_hidden_factory_desc: "The ruins of an ancient structure lied hidden until we uncovered their remains. They predate the colonization of this planet and emit regular seismic signals, as a machine that has never knew when to stop."
    #Stage 0 - Discovered site after block clear
    pw_archaeology.601.name: "Hidden Factory"
    pw_archaeology.601.desc: "The crew clearing the land of [THIS.GetName] has made a breathtaking discovery - their seismic sensors detected strange signals during the operation and, upon investigation, they found a hidden entrance to ancient ruins of unknown origin among the planetary features, dating from before our presence on this planet. So far, their excavation has revealed remnants of what seems like an ancient industrial structure, surprisingly advanced and somewhat cloaked. Even more unlikely, the seismic activity suggests that the structure extends deeply underground and is still in operation!\n\nWe should establish an archaeological site in order to investigate further."
    pw_archaeology.601.a: "A mysterious prospection! Start digging!"
    pw_archaeology.601.b: "We have nothing to learn from the past."

    #Stage 1 - Entrance examination
    pw_archaeology.605.name: "Surface Exploration"
    pw_archaeology.605.desc: "As the team explores the ancient industrial ruins it becomes clear that it extends deeply underground, so deep in fact that it may breach the planetary crust and reach its mantle. Whichever civilization that constructed this facility was clearly very ambitious and quite technologically advanced. Already in an initial inspection, we have found many autonomous systems still in operation, cutting-edge tools and powerful machines. Everything appears to be in fairly good condition, even if many of the machines have starved their inputs long ago.\n\nThe team has decided to dedicate some extra time studying the designs and workings of these machines to wee what they can discover."
    #Stage 2 - Stash of Consumer Goods
    pw_archaeology.610.name: "Industrial Stash"
    pw_archaeology.610.desc: "After collecting most of the data the entrance had to offer, the archaeological team decided to descend further into the industrial facility, reaching one of the proper production floors of this factory. This entire place seems to be designed in such a way to quickly switch between the production of civilian and military products, using a system of modular workstations, organized by the autonomous robotic units left still working here.\n\nWithout information input from the outside world, the machine workers of this factory have simply maintained the previously set production goal and have produced finished goods until they ran out of material, long ago. Also, some kind of failure has been observed on the distribution and logistics systems of this floor, leading to a large amount of consumer goods to pile-up at the end of the assembly line. These are interestingly design appliances with the purpose of heating food - or cooling it - or both, the design is too alien for us to determine."
    pw_archaeology.610.a: "Bring those goods to the surface, we will have some use for them."
    pw_archaeology.610.b: "Someone will pay good money for these exotic products."
    pw_archaeology.610.c: "Analyse them, they might hold more technological advancements."
    #Stage 3 - Stash of Alloys
    pw_archaeology.615.name: "Military Cache"
    pw_archaeology.615.desc: "The archaeological team was able to fix part of the logistics system an send the recovered goods back to the surface. Now they can continue their exploration further down the facility.\n\nTheir descend brings them to a different production floor, after passing by many disabled robots and inoperable machines. This one seems to be configured to produce high quality metal alloy, suited for the construction of spacecrafts, and to fully utilize the geography of the facility, receiving mineral input from extractors far below. Unfortunately, it seems that this production line has automatically shut down after fulfilling its last shipment order, many centuries ago. Fortunately, according to the system logs, that shipment has never left the facility. After some searching, the team has encountered the broken freight elevator that was supposed to take the cargo to the surface and they could take this opportunity to study the transportation system, attempt to fix the elevator and recover the cargo. What is certain is that they will require additional energy to power the elevator, if we wish to bring the alloys to the surface."
    pw_archaeology.615.a: "More alloys is always good."
    pw_archaeology.615.b: "Limit your efforts to studying the system."
    #Stage 4 - Exhausted Minerals
    pw_archaeology.620.name: "Industrial Tragedy"
    pw_archaeology.620.desc: "After analyzing the transportation and production systems of the alloy assembly line, the team continued their descend, approaching the deepest parts of the facility.\n\nAs they explored, they discovered that the last levels of the factory are completely dedicated to the extraction of minerals in order to feed the machines above. Deep below the surface, multiple mining tunnels branch out in every direction, most of them populated by malfunctioning machines - automated mining robots that still attempt to fulfil their purpose, but are too damaged to work properly and not damaged enough to stop.\n\nAn unfortunate realization came to our archaeological team: given these newly discoverd tunnels and the machines that still attempt to mine them, our projected extraction of mineral has taken a considerable hit. This world is simply much more geologically poorer that we had predicted. Doubly unfortunately, while examining the autonomous mining units, the expedition leader §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! carelessly got a limb stuck on the machines gears! While the worst has passed and other expedition member already assisted [Root.Leader.GetHerHim], [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] will carry some scars."
    pw_archaeology.620.a: "What a tragic streak of event."
    #Stage 5 - Final Choice
    pw_archaeology.625.name: "The Factory Grows"
    pw_archaeology.625.desc: "The final report of our archaeological team is ready and they are prepared to leave the ruins of the facility. With all of the data they have gathered and proper knowledge of the facility, it would be a waste to let a functional facility like this work itself to destruction. We could appropriate a good portion of the installations to fabricate our own goods and alloys, it would not be working at full capacity, but could serve us well enough. Alternatively, we can try and push the factory to its limit, a limit clouded by our limited understanding of the technology, but that could better resemble its prime."
    pw_archaeology.625.a: "Indeed, the factory must grow."
    pw_archaeology.625.b: "Repurpose the factory on overdrive. What could go wrong?"
    pw_archaeology.625.c: "Integrate our reproduction protocols with their systems."
    pw_archaeology.625.d: "Dismantle the factory, we don't need more accidents."
