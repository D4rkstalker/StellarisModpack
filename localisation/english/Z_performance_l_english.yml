 z_performance_start_title_desc: "Since version 2.2 a brand new £pops£§Y population§! system, which is called POPs in short, had been added into Stellaris. There is a very complex checking system that sweeps through all POPs in the Galaxy everyday to make sure that everyone will be assigned the right job. But in the late game, the game will lag so much because too many POPs will be checked.\n\nThis pop-up window is to inform you that §YInfinite Collection: POP-Job Checking System Optimization§! is working and request for your permission to perform the optimization.\n\n§GOptimization§! won't have noticeable influence on gameplay but dramatically boost performance. Certainly, you can manaully turn on the optimization later, and make detailed setting in the customization menu."

 z_performance_title_desc: "Since version 2.2 a brand new £pops£§Y population§! system, which is called POPs in short, had been added into Stellaris. There is a very complex checking system that sweeps through all POPs in the Galaxy everyday to make sure that everyone will be assigned the right job. However, in the late game, numerous POPs mean serious performance hit. \n\nWhat this MOD does is to optimize this POP checking system as far as it could.\n\n£time£The POPs checking starts on §Ythe 4th day§! of each month to avoid the complex monthly statistics, and you can choose a checking density to perform POPs checking; lower density means better performance. What's more, you can also totally turn this checking function off to get the best performance."
