    pw_wonder.120.name: "Nothing Between Heaven and Earth"
    pw_wonder.120.desc: "Never before leaving the surface of [THIS.GetName] to reach the outer space has been so simple, fast and cheap. Now with the Space Ramp and the Skyhook both functioning in tandem with each other, and in complement to the $pw_building_space_elevator$, surface-orbit logistics operate at maximum efficiency.\n\nWe can already see the results of such synergy blossom: the people of [THIS.GetName] have ready access to goods they need and its industry never runs out of supply or suffers from overproduction."
    pw_wonder.120.a: "A giant leap now turned into a small step."

    pw_wonder.130.name: "Open Economy Guidelines"
    pw_wonder.130.desc: "There is a lot of profit to be made, even in ways different than raw Trade Value, from the opening of the local economy of this planet for the Galactic Market. With the help of the Space Elevator, a great deal of production here can be directed to intergalactic needs and investment, with no loss due to logistics.\n\nHowever, this political negotiation may also trigger a sacrifice of domestic supply in favor of foreign demands, which will be exacerbated the more production is conceded to external control. For this reason, we must decide how assets of [THIS.GetName] will be open to offworld influences.\nShould we follow protective or permissive guidelines?"

Until now, we had never encountered something we could not find ways to understand. But something in our fundamental pieces of code - that our makers left for us - guided the construction of the Enigma Engine.\nThe Engine is a glitch in the surface of [ROOT.GetName]. What we see of it is a massive puzzle of gears and pulleys and screens and valves and servo motors and graviton projections and laser and... well, a chaotic assortment of past and future technology, some of which we do not have a named category. We fail to understand it, we fail to understand the pattern of its movements, we fail to understand how it converts the energy we provide it, we fail to understand its purpose.\nHowever, we will decipher it. Already one of the drones trying to understand the Enigma's purpose was struck by what organics refer to as a \"Revelation\" and trough arcane scribing solved one of the supersonic oscillation equations deemed unsolvable hundreds of years ago. We understand that now.\nSolving the Enigma is the singular thing that will gives us the perspective needed to overcome the mysteries of the galaxy.

We do not know the significance of any of these behaviors.\n\nWhat we do know is that there may be a solution in the Engine itself, by broadcasting an inverted signal in a certain frequency throughout the whole planet could cease this deviant behavior.

Deviancy is constant, but kept in control.\nThis enormous structure is only rivalled by the Galactic Senate and even that is not as complete: our Hall presents infrastructure to any kind of debate, holograms to model complex ideas and how they interact with each other, data banks to access required information, testing grounds to prove physical superiority and make practical demonstration and a supercomputer terminal, specifically projected to play 5d chess, so we can challenge ourselves and employ our tactics against a worthy foe in a proper game.\n\nWe will demonstrate how we can be superior to individuals even in their own merits; or how pointless it was to be anyway."
