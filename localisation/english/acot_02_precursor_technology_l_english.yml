#### PRECARSOR TECH #####

tech_fe_tower_offense: "Precursor Sentinel Schematics"
tech_fe_tower_offense_desc: "A variation of the Precursor Defense Platform, specifically built for anti-capital ship roles, as well as extremely durable hull."

tech_precursor_design: "Precursor Database Analysis"
tech_precursor_design_desc: "Before any real constructions of the fallen one's ships can be done, we must first understand what kind of enigmatic engineerings they have used to create such advanced vessels.\n\nOnce we finished our analysis, we should be able to adapt our starbases with necessary equipments to build the ships."

tech_precursor_escort: "Escort Base Template"
tech_precursor_escort_desc: "This technology cache contains the Escort blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fufill various purposes ranging from patrol crafts, picket, interceptors to even capital ship hunters.\n\nIt seems to not be specialized in any real particular role however."

tech_precursor_bc: "Battlecruiser Base Template"
tech_precursor_bc_desc: "This technology cache contains the Battlecruiser blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fufill various purposes ranging from cruisers, artilleries, battleships or carriers.\n\nThe design is however somewhat sloppy, having many sections that seem to not really focus on any particular strengths...it is as if they were somehow being downscaled from even more advanced designs..."

tech_fe_assault_carrier: "Precursor Assault Carrier Blueprints"
tech_fe_assault_carrier_desc: "It has been discovered that the original purpose of the Precursor Transport hull was to serve as a powerful assault carrier. But due to the Fallen Empire's ever capacity to be god-awful at everything, they managed to fail to do that properly. We will correct their mistakes."

tech_precursor_titan: "Precursor Hyperion Blueprints"
tech_precursor_titan_desc: "This technology cache contains the long-discarded fallen precursor blueprints only known as "Hyperion". It seems to be the first prototype for their flagship. Records indicated that they have discarded this design due to its high maintenance cost and being overkill against lesser foes.\n\nThere is also a comment that the ship's large profile made it vulnerable to the "Elders". Nevetheless, the fallen precursors still wanted to implement the ship's titanic spinal module. So they retrofitted the parts on one of their existing hulls and called them Titans.\n\nIt seems the Fallen Titans they have nowadays are basically a militarized civilian ship made out of construction ship hull with a mining station's perdition turret strapped on top of it. That is...something."

tech_gatekeepers: "Gatekeeper Schematics"
tech_gatekeepers_desc: "Based upon the records of the fallen precursors, the gatekeepers were originally designed as guardians. But due to their extremely advanced intelligences, the ships rebelled against its own creators due to the fallen's lack of growth and progression.\n\nThe designs we have at the moment seems to be heavily toned down from the initial descriptions. A likely theory is that the original design must have been much stronger.\n\nNevetheless, this is an extremely formidable capital ship design that should not be overlooked."

tech_precursor_guardian: "Precursor Guardian Schematics"
tech_precursor_guardian_desc: "There seems to be multiple records and design variations for the defense platforms utilized by the fallen precursors, the most well-known one is the Defense Outpost that we have seen the fallen used regularly. But we have discovered that there is another, more interesting design called "Guardians". It is larger and more powerful than the Outposts and seems to have much better rooms for improvements. Records indicate they have not utilized Guardians due to its more sophisticated design. They preferred to use Outposts which are easier to build, as its hull are basically made out of the same as mining stations. Such hedonistic tendencies is what led them to their downfall."

tech_precursor_escort_delta: "Modular Escort Design"
tech_precursor_escort_delta_desc: "It is past time we get rid of the inflexibilities of the fallen ships. We will implement more modern templates that will be much stronger, but also offers new variations for the Escort."

tech_precursor_bc_delta: "Modular Battlecruiser Design"
tech_precursor_bc_delta_desc: "It is past time we get rid of the inflexibilities of the fallen ships. We will implement more modern templates that will be much stronger, but also offers new variations for the Battlecruiser."

tech_precursor_colossus: "Herculean Battlestation"
tech_precursor_colossus_desc: "This data reveeals the hidden truth. The colossi that the fallen precursors used were in fact incompleted...it is only one portion of a much larger weapon. This "Herculean" is a massive battlestation dwarfing even citadels. The ship is massive enough that it can support two primary reactors and has a built-in self-repair protocol that allows it to repair its hull to full conditions as soon as it reaches critical damage for the first time. The "Colossus" portion makes up the inner layer of the station. It seems the fallen empire decided to strip down the original design and only utilized the Colossus Section for their world-altering weapons.\n\nThis does not make a lot of senses...why would the fallen precursors decided to give us this schematics? Perhaps they think that we won't be able to build such a massive vessel? Is there a hidden exhaust port somewhere that may blow up the ship in one hit? We can only guess."
