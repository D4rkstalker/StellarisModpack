### ARMIES ###

pasmod_assault_army_default_plural:0 "Planetary Assault Armies"
pasmod_assault_army_default_desc:0 "Elite troops trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Escort Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. These "Space Marines" are fielded in smaller numbers than traditional assault armies, as there is limited room for soldiers and equipment aboard a proper warship."
pasmod_assault_army_clone:0 "Clone Assault Unit"
pasmod_assault_army_clone_plural:0 "Clone Assault army units"
pasmod_assault_army_clone_desc:0 "Elite specialized clone troopers bred and trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Escort Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. Their lack of personal initiative is deemed an acceptable trade-off for their total obedience to orders and relative disposability."
pasmod_assault_army_gene:0 "Orbital Drop Assault Division"
pasmod_assault_army_gene_plural:0 "Orbital Drop Assault Divisions"
pasmod_assault_army_gene_desc:0 "Massive assault division including genetically engineered special forces."

pasmod_assault_army_psionic_force:0 "Psionic Special Forces"
pasmod_assault_army_psionic_force_desc:0 "Elite soldiers gifted with psionic abilities and trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Escort Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. These psionic warriors focus on the use of destructive psionic powers to remove the enemy's willingness to fight, shattering their morale and winning quick victories with few casualties."
pasmod_assault_army_slave_army:0 "Slave Troops"
pasmod_assault_army_slave_army_desc:0 "Slaves trained to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Escort Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. Most are conscripted by force, but many slaves volunteer in a desperate attempt to increase their food rations or escape from grueling labor. As a bonus, slaves are inherently disposable; there are always more bodies to fuel the Empire's glorious expansion."
pasmod_assault_army_droid_army:0 "Droid Army"
pasmod_assault_army_droid_army_desc:0 "Cold, heartless killing machines designed specifically to invade lightly-defended planets with little to no support, based on Escort Carrier vessels and deployed by orbital drop pods. They are immune to the effects of poor morale that plague organic combat units, and will fight to the last droid standing."
