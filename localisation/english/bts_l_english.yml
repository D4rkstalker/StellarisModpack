According to the allegations, these black market trades have been fueling our enemies with high tech weapons.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to pinpoint any [target_rival_country.GetAdjective] officer to hold responsible for such claims, but the fact that [target_rival_country.GetName] is plotting against us has caught the attention of our diplomats, severely affecting our opinion of them."

Some of our key members of the external affairs department are now lobbying against the [target_rival_country.GetAdjective] empire. The continuously growing tension between our empires could damage our diplomatic stance with them."

While this is usually of no significance, the fact that a highly known polititian of the [target_rival_country.GetAdjective] empire was being disrespectful towards our customs is causing a lot of tension.\n\nClaims have been made about the hologram being fake, but ever since it became viral, a lot of dirty laundry is being aired in public.

Per [target_rival_country.GetAdjective] law, these babies would be considered par of the empire and would abide to their laws and customs.\n\nWhile this sort of issues happen on a regular basis, the fact that a diplomatic member of the [target_rival_country.GetAdjective] empire has been smuggling babies from our planets has put them in a tight corner."
