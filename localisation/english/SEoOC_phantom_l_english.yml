 nep_phantom.3000.desc:0 "After we activated orbs, the two orbs shook their energy in a certain direction after resonating with each other, but there was no movement after that, as if nothing happened."

 nep_phantom.3001.desc:0 "our border suddenly observe something might be remnants of the Krah'en Empire. But we don't have their exactly intel, The military officers think this is fake news. However, news has been reported it greatly, and some border systems have experienced small-scale panic."

 nep_phantom.3002.desc:0 "Our border suddenly appeared unidentified fleets. They are said to be called §Y§Y[event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName]§! by a certain country. They do not respond to any communication. Any attack is invalid for them, and no one knows what their purpose is."
 nep_phantom.3002.a:0 "Stay tuned."

 nep_phantom.3003.desc:0 "After research on the existence of §Y[event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName]§!, we determined that they are all in the uncertain phase. What we have to do is to lock them. But locking a whole,moving fleet is much more difficult than locking a planet. Scientists have come up with basic ideas and need more research."
 nep_phantom.3003.a:0 "Finally found a way to deal with these things."
 
 nep_phantom.3004.name:0 "Pull Up the Roots"
 nep_phantom.3004.desc:0 "We have destroyed dozens of §Y[event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName]§!, but they seem to be endless. Maybe we have to find out where they came from?"

 nep_phantom.3005.name:0 "Old place"
 nep_phantom.3005.desc:0 "Our scientists found out where the existence of §Y[event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName]§! came from. Perhaps everyone will not be surprised: they are from the center of the galaxy, the third sub seal which kept slience before. The third sub seal seems to warp all incoming fleet in an unidentified way (it do this in a high spped, so our sensor don't function before), and the origin looks quite distant --- But we felt a very weak energy response similar to Orb from that direction. The brave probe group conducted a biotransmission test on the third sub-seal under the code of §Y[event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName]§!, confirming that even if someone's fleet is transmitting, it has no effect; but if the transmission is a large fleet, it looks like It will lead to a period of inability to use. If there are enemies on the opposite side, the fleet may need to defend itself against the enemy. "
 nep_phantom.3005.a:0 "Call our strongest fleet, we must solve them."

Although we can never know the cause of this incident, we solved them and found orb.

They are orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§! and nobody knows what they want to do. Our military tried various ways to intercept it, but our attacks are completely ineffective and they don't accept any communication. They seem to be looming, and some even think that this is the ghost of the Krah'en empire -- of course, this is impossible. In addition, the military and the civil society have given them many names: Ghost, Illusion, Blurs, and Phantom. Would you better give them an offical name?"

All major hospitals are overcrowded, and not only our citizens, but all animals and plants and even robots have experienced varying degrees of weakness. The disease is generally considered to be related to §Y[event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName]§!, but because there is no source of infection, and there is no evidence that they have dropped the biological weapons, everything are still a mystery."
