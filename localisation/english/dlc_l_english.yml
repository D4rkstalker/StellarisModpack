  complexDLC.101.desc:0 "§WForgotten Queens§! has been updated!\n 2.50 AND Lithoids are now supported!!.\nOrigins and Federations are nearly here too, which means some civics might get a rework or be moved as an origin once the patch is pushed. All of this is done thanks to my Patreon supporters, if you want to help please dont hessitate to do so at §Whttps://patreon.com/hivemods§!!\n\n§YForgotten Queens 2.50a: The Hive Rocks!§!\n As if you didn't get enough rock puns already hahaha. So, without further ado, the patchnotes:\n\nPatch §B2.50a:§!\n- Reworked Organic Structures to make it compatible with Lithoids: Lithoids now get Living Structures instead, which eat minerals instead of consuming energy credits.\n -Thriving Prey has been slightly reworked to bring compatibility with other mods!\n- Overmind now creates blockers according to the remote drone pop, so if your remote drones are lithoids you will get 4 monoliths.\n- Reworked Natural Attraction: It now provides +100% livestock minerals/food (Acording to species being farmed) instead of +1 food from livestock.\n- Updated gamerules to be consistent with 2.50 vanilla patch.\n- Planetary Digester now creates minerals as well if the pops are Lithoids.\n- Added sound effects to Planetary Digester\n\n\nPlease report any bugs and suggestions on Steam, Twitter or Reddit. Enjoy the game and cya next time!"
