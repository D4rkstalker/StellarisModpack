    tech_negative_pressure_desc:0 "Negative pressure is a phenomenon that has occurred before at the quantum-mechanical cassimere-effect. There it manifests in form of vacuum energy, but is unfortunately uncontrollable. Applied Abstract Physics has lead to the discovery of alternative, more useful and better applicable ways to generate and control negative pressure. It could be used within various application fields, but particularly in the manipulation of ultra-high-intensity space-distortions, like black holes."

Oscillating tachyon field projection plates, which actively control the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the higgs-field in a localized volume, through vacuum energy density resonance stimulation.
