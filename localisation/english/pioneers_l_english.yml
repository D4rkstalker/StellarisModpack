 START_SCREEN_PIONEERS:0 "Ever since we first looked up to the night sky, we [GetSpeciesNamePlural] have been inspired to perform great works. As our technology evolved, we seized upon the opportunity to take our place among the stars ourselves. Early rocket propulsion gave way to to more efficient means to escape [GetHomeWorldName]'s gravity, culminating in the construction of an Orbital Elevator from [GetHomeWorldName]'s equatorial region, bridging the gap from the surface of our home to the first of many permanent space installations.\n\nWith easy access to orbit, our civilization expanded across the planets of our solar system, and soon we looked towards our closest neighboring stars for worlds capable of harboring our civilization. Despite the challenges, great slower than light ark ships were constructed and sent across the stars, carrying brave pioneers to their new homes, and forever leaving behind Mother [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nNow, however, with the discovery of the Hyperspace Network and creation of our first FTL drive, it has come time to truly take to the stars, and discover what happened to our initial colonization efforts."

 #Orphan Wormhole Line 
 pioneer.5.name:0 "Hyperspace Disturbance"
 pioneer.5.desc:0 "Deep space observation from [FromFrom.GetName] has revealed a disturbance in the dimensional barrier between real and hyperspace in the outer system. While invisible to conventional sensors, like those possessed by the colony ship, the more sophisticated sensors developed in the last 100 years allowed us to detect the anomaly.\n\n[Leader.researchingscientist.GetName] believes that the anomaly might be the explanation for where our Pioneers have disappeared too. It is possible that the disturbance could flare into prominence and form an unstable passage through hyperspace, a passage that the colony ship might have inadvertently traveled through with its sensors being unable to detect the danger.\n\nIt may be possible by sending a sufficiently powerful and focused gravitational pulse to temporarily open the passage and stabilize it long enough to investigate the other side for our missing people."
 pioneer.5.a:0 "Dispatch a Science Ship at once!"
 
 pioneer.6.name:0 "The Other Side"
 pioneer.6.desc:0 "The Hyperspace Disturbance has been successfully stabilized, and the first probe sent by the [Root.GetName] has found the missing colony ship in orbit of the anomaly's gravity well. Accessing the ship's systems reveals that the ship is in working order, and the cryopods carrying the Pioneers are still functional. Remarkably, the ship's sensors have been observing the system since falling through the anomaly 50 years ago, and sifting through the data has revealed the system holds a habitable world ideal for [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] as well as being rich in resources.\n\nHowever, [Root.Leader.GetName] believes it is only a matter of time before the anomaly collapses and won't be able to be stabilized again from our end. While the colony ship can be programmed to make its way back through the passage and allow us to awaken its passengers and settle them on [FromFromFromFrom.GetName], we could alternatively program it to set a course for the habitable world on the other side and awaken the crew there.\n\nLimitations on cryogenic technology from the ship's creation prevents us from returning any of the crew to sleep for the journey if we wake them, but we could leave a message and a record of technological innovations since the ship was launched, but will otherwise be unable to contact them until they stabilize the passage from their side."

 pioneer.7.desc:0 "Faint radio signals have been detected from the dormant hyperspace anomaly in [pioneer_warp_system.GetName]. Although badly garbled and distorted from passing through the anomaly, we have managed to correct enough of the distortion to confirm that they are communications from our displaced Pioneers!\n\nThe crew of the colony ship used the probe left behind by the [FromFromFromFrom.GetName] as a relay to increase the odds that their transmissions could traverse the anomaly, but attempts to reach the probe from our side have proved futile - leaving us only able to receive until the passage is opened again.\n\nMeanwhile, our Pioneers have completed their transition into the target planet's orbit and were awoken by the onboard computer. While the news of their location, and our people's advancements were a surprise, they seem to have gladly thrown themselves to the task of settling the world they've dubbed New Frontier."

 pioneer.8.name:0 "Whispers Through the Cracks"
 pioneer.8.desc:0 "The colony on New Frontier has proceeded at an exceptional pace. 40 years after making planetfall, the colony has begun to send probes across the system equipped with the principles of hyperspace technology left in the colony ship's data banks.\n\nCuriously, it appears that the system is remarkably close to [Root.Capital.GetStarName] but does not appear to connect to the Hyperspace Network, leaving it unable to be reached except by conventional, slower than light travel - making it all the more important to stabilize the hyperspace anomaly that sent the Pioneers to the system.\n\nFortunately, our star cast brethren have already put plans forward to construct a station at the mouth of the anomaly to begin exploring the feasibility of wedging it open from their side."
 pioneer.8.a:0 "Soon our people will be reunited."
 
 pioneer.9.name:0 "The Cracks Widen"
 pioneer.9.desc:0 "Over the last few years, the radio signals coming from New Frontier have been arriving with greater frequency and clarity, detailing the construction of the station and the progression of their society independent of our own.\n\nYet it still came as a bit of a shock when the disturbance was seen reopening, albeit in a much more diminutive shape, and the first live transmission from our displaced colonists garbled across our sensors!"
 pioneer.9.a:0 "Open communications!"
 
 pioneer.10.name:0 "Reunion"
 pioneer.10.desc:0 "This is New Horizon, calling the [Root.GetName]. We should receive you loud and clear."
 pioneer.10.a:0 "How are our messages getting through now?"
 
 pioneer.800.desc:0 "We built upon the principle used to open and temporarily stabilize the anomaly on your side. Using a smaller, constant stream of gravitons, we managed to open a passage just large enough on both sides for communications to slip through without destabilizing it further.\n\nThe only problem was waiting for the anomaly to reconnect with your side before doing so."
 pioneer.800.a:0 "We got your earlier reports. New Horizon treated you well."
 pioneer.800.ar:0 "New Horizon exceeded our wildest predictions for an exoplanet, almost like it's been fine tuned for life to thrive upon it. With a system as rich in resources as [Capital_scope.Solar_system.GetName] that helped our people expand faster than we ever could have believed otherwise.\n\nThe few members of the expedition who were upset by your decision to send us here quickly grew quiet when we made these discoveries, especially since none of us ever expected to return home when we first got in those pods. And now, most of our population has never seen [Root.Capital.GetName] outside of old videos and photos, being born on New Horizon to care about anything like that."
 pioneer.800.b:0 "Connect with our side?"
 pioneer.801.desc:0 "The anomaly is always present on our side, and has been open ever since Pioneer 1 first inadvertently traveled through it, and more than likely long before we did. We thought that this would make it easier to return, but discovered shortly after we began work on the task that only this side of the passage remains fixed.\n\nThere are some dozen different systems that the anomaly tries, and fails, to connect too, creating only short term passages before it expends its energy and becomes too unstable to use. We believe it might be an Orphan Wormhole – a theoretical hyperspace anomaly without a partner to form a stable feedback loop. But with the right sort of conditions on both ends, we believe it's possible to create a partner for it, and thus make it a permanent stable passage!"
 pioneer.801.a:0 "Couldn't we connect the wormhole to [Root.Capital_scope.Solar_system.GetName] instead?"
 pioneer.801.ar:0 "Only with substantially more gravitational energy on hand to create half a wormhole from scratch. The conditions in [pioneer_bad_ideal.GetName] aren't close enough to create a wormhole, but it's close enough that the Orphan tries to connect to it. And over thousands of years of such attempts has worn the barrier between real space and hyperspace even further.\n\nIts possible that if left to its own devices for the next several thousand years it might create a partner from one of these systems and stabilize - but since we're here we can help it along and ensure it opens where we want it to."
 pioneer.801.b:0 "We've come across wormholes before, but never one with properties like this."
 pioneer.801.br:0 "It's possible all wormholes start like this until they create another opening and stabilize, but with the age of the universe and the fleeting period before an Orphan makes a partner, it's not too surprising that they are so rare.\n\nOr maybe one wormhole will automatically partner with another to stabilize, and our Orphan is just the unlucky odd of the galaxy."
 pioneer.801.c:0 "Give us the plans, we'll prepare to stabilize the passage on our end."
 pioneer.801.cr:0 "Transmitting now. When we start things on our side the Disturbance should manifest once more on yours."
 pioneer.801.d:0 "This isn't the first Wormhole we've stabilized."
 pioneer.801.dr:0 "Hyperspace Physics has seemingly made leaps and bounds in the [Root.GetName] since your last care package of technology. Physicists here spent nearly a decade just figuring their way around the math last time, but we should get our heads around this much quicker. The data should remarkably fine tune the process on our end and make it even easier on yours, too."

 pioneer.13.name:0 "The Bridge is Built"
 pioneer.13.desc:0 "In a flash of synchronized graviton pulses, the barrier between dimensions is torn in [pioneer_warp_spawn.GetName], as a new wormhole swells into prominence then finally stabilizes with the Oprhan. All that is left to do is send a science ship through to chart the area of hyperspace between here and [pioneer_warp_system.GetName] before a flurry of diplomatic and trade vessels pour through to reunite our species.\n\nWhile the colony of New Horizon has willingly placed itself underneath the authority of [GetName], a hundred years of self reliance has given the colony a degree of autonomy unlike others of our Empire, requiring time and effort to fully integrate our people underneath one state."
 pioneer.13.worm.desc:0 "In a flash of synchronized graviton pulses, the barrier between dimensions is torn in [pioneer_warp_spawn.GetName], as a new wormhole swells into prominence then finally stabilizes with the Orphan. The sight of the stabilized wormhole within our empire has left quite the impression with the people, and the first of many envoys and trade ventures hoping to bridge the divide between our people tentatively wait for our science teams to confirm the passage is safe and stable.\n\nWhile the colony of New Horizon has willingly placed itself underneath the authority of [GetName], a hundred years of self reliance has given the colony a degree of autonomy unlike others of our Empire, requiring time and effort to fully integrate our people underneath one state.\n\nThe process to stabilize the Orphan has been a huge boon to our science division, with the data collected on both sides of the Oprhan being poured over by physicists throughout the [GetName]. Initial reports believe that the process could be adapted to be used by a science vessel to stabilize other wormholes across the galaxy."

 #Abducted Line
 pioneer.4.name:0 "Sundered Dreams"
 pioneer.4.desc:0 "The mystery of the missing pioneers came to a morose answer, as further sweeps through the system found an object entering the system in a highly elliptical orbit. Initial observations quickly discovered that it was the ruined remains of the colony ship which had left [Root.Capital.GetStarName] 100 years ago.\n\nWhile there is no shortage of potential dangers in space, an investigation of the debris could help determine exactly what happened to our colonists, as well as see if any of the cryopods might have remained functional."
 pioneer.4.a:0 "However unlikely, it's worth a look for survivors."

 pioneer.200.name:0 "Answers in the Debris" 
 pioneer.200.desc:0 "As the construction ship makes one last pass across the massive beam which served as Pioneer 2's spine, it makes the somber report that there are no surviving pods. The damage to the ship practically ripped out its main engine, leaving the back ups to sputter out only a few decades afterwards, killing any [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] still in their pods.\n\nMore harrowing is that most of the pods were empty, and analysis of the damage has revealed that it was inflicted by a directed high energy weapon which destroyed the ship's primary power plant, disabling the vessel in one strike. Accessing what survived of the ship's computer shows that the ship made a course correction to avoid an object on an intercept course, followed by the multiple system failures from the disabling strike. Multiple cryopods were then logged as being opened by manual over ride before the ship was left to drift silently through the system in its long orbit until our discovery.\n\nIts hard to escape the conclusion that the crew was abducted, but the only question is, by what?"
 pioneer.200.a:0 "Log the weapon signatures, we'll find who's responsible."

 pioneer.313.c:0 "A regrettable conclusion..."

 pioneer.314.name:0 "A New Dawn"
 pioneer.314.desc:0 "Xenobiologists on [Root.GetName] report that the wildlife on the planet has been making surprising gains since the crystals destruction. In every direction they look, from soil bacteria to large vertebrates, the sickly pale that once existed throughout the ecosystem is slowly lifting.\n\nWith the right intervention, we may be able to get the planet back to its original splendor, with the expected benefits that would come to our colony."
 pioneer.314.a:0 "We shall gaze upon the world of our Pioneers at last."

 pioneer.315.name:0 "Cleansed of Life"
 pioneer.315.desc:0 "Video from [Root.GetName] shows the planet's destruction, as a wave of death extends out from the crystal's shadow. [Owner.Species.GetNamePlural] are seen madly scrambling, trying to find passage off the planet before their doom comes, only for the crowd to fall to the ground drained of their life force. Plants, animals, even the microbial life of the planet are devoured in the crystal's gluttonous wake, collapsing dead as the creature gorges. Soon, the only noise from the planet is the various autonomous systems, continuing until safeties trigger and shut down the generators which fuel their operation. In time, the corpses will atrophy, the plants wilt, leaving only their bodies behind until the weathering of the sun and wind sweeps away the evidence of the catastrophe now that no life exists to even decompose the remains.\n\nThe creature responsible hums with its psychic resonance above, faintly visible through the haze of the planet's atmosphere on the recordings. The seemingly delicate arches of its structure glow with the power of its feast as it hovers over the world it had killed. Until, hours later, the life form turns away, drifting slowly through the system before it blinks away to unknown parts of the galaxy."
 pioneer.315.a:0 "All we can do is pick up the pieces..."

 pioneer.317.name:0 "A Verdant World Once More"
 pioneer.317.desc:0 "The rejuvenation project on [Root.GetName] has succeeded beyond our wildest imaginings. The once pale and squalid ecosystem has become a teaming wilderness, or at least the start of one. Agricultural experts on [Root.GetName] have reported higher yields thanks to the mutualistic bacteria within the soil, while the majority of colonists have reported the planet being far more conductive to survival."
 pioneer.317.a:0 "Excellent."

 #Cleanup Events
 pioneer.998.name:0 "[From.GetName] Space Elevator"
 pioneer.998.desc:0 "The former controllers of [From.GetName] were apparently fond of large structures called Space Elevators to ferry supplies to and from orbit without the aid of large freighters. While the idea has merit for them, our own technicians are incapable of maintaining the structure for any length of time or putting it to much work, and something must be done with it."
 pioneer.998.a:0 "Arrange for the structure to be safely dismantled."
 pioneer.998.b:0 "Collapse the structure now and limit the damage."
 pioneer.998.c:0 "Let it collapse as it may, its of no concern to us."
  
 pioneer.997.name:0 "[This.GetName] Elevator Collapses"
 pioneer.997.desc:0 "The Space Elevator in [This.GetName] has finally collapsed after a rogue meteoroid crashed through the cable bridging the surface to its anchor. Unfortunately, the structure was snapped near its middle, causing only half of the tower to be flung from the planet's orbit, and the other half to crash across the surface, creating untold damage in its wake."
 pioneer.997.a:0 "Oops."

 pioneer.996.name:0 "Space Elevator Reclaimed!"
 pioneer.996.desc:0 "The Space Elevator on [This.GetName] was left to the weathering of space without being utilized by its former owners who apparently lacked the sophistication to utilize the structure, opting instead for more expensive ship based alternatives. Its a rather simple matter to begin refurbishing the structure and putting it to use once more."
 pioneer.996.a:0 "Excellent"
