 psionic_hive.2600.name:0 "Overmind"
 psionic_hive.2600.desc:0 "Since we gained consciousness, our synaptic drones reported cases of drones that would continue to comunicate and be part of the collective thinking even after their bodies died out, which can only be described as supernatural in nature. Until recently, these cases were just disregarded or misunderstood.\n\nNow, however, our scientists have finally obtained conclusive evidence that proves the psionic potential inherent in certain [Root.GetSpeciesName] drones. Although only a very small minority of our species as a whole seems to be gifted with psionic powers, their numbers relative to the total population have grown steadily over just the last few centuries.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of sudden evolutionary growth-spurt or because something has triggered latent psionic abilities that were always present in our genetic code, scientists cannot say.\n\nThese new powers allow us to exist without the need of any physical form and invade the minds of lesser beings, assimilating them into the collective."
 psionic_hive.2600.a:0 "A glimpse, perhaps, of the future that awaits us."
 psionic_hive.2602.name:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] Displays Psionic Potential"
 psionic_hive.2602.desc:0 "Latent psionic powers have begun to manifest in certain drones belonging to the [From.GetSpeciesName] species. This must be a fairly recent development, since we have no record of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ever displaying psionic abilities on file.\n\n[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] in the §Y[From.GetName]§! has offered no explanation."
 psionic_hive.2650.name:0 "The Great Awakening"
 psionic_hive.2650.desc:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] has experienced what can only be described as a Great Awakening. For a time now, we have been aware of the great psionic potential inherent in our species and the presence of another realm, but such powers have only manifested themselves in a limited way... until now.\n\nAlmost overnight, [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] has unlocked its full psionic capacity. It is as if some sort of communal pool of [Root.GetSpeciesName] psychic energy finally reached a critical tipping point, collectively awakening the latent abilities of our brains.\n\nWe are now tied with the universe in a way we could have ever imagined, looking at this new realm to communicate with."
 psionic_hive.2652.name:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] Awaken Psionic Abilities"
 psionic_hive.2652.desc:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] has now unlocked its full psychic potential.\n\nOur scientists predict that with enough psionic power, a collective mind like [From.GetName] could have, theoretically, the power to remotely submit others to their collective, navigate through other realms or even predict the future. What does this mean for the rest of the galaxy remains to be seen."
  psionic_hive.2655.desc:0 "Like a muffled whisper in a dark room, the Shroud calls to us from within our mind. It is a primordial realm of pure psychic energy that came into being at the dawn of time. All creatures that have been gifted with psionic abilities tap into the Shroud in some way to draw power, even if only subconsciously.\n\nSince our transcendence, we have begun to see the Shroud with greater clarity. There are patterns where once even our strongest synapse drones could see only a formless mass of swirling energy. There are... other things, as well. Spirits of a sort, that gaze back on us from the other side. Sometimes with curiousity, sometimes with kindness... and sometimes with malice.\n\nWe are still in the process of learning the extent of our new powers, but it may be possible for us to commune with these spirits. It will require the combined efforts of our most powerful synaptic drones."
  psionic_hive.2656.desc:0 "After days of being locked in an hypnotic trance, our synaptic drones in the collective have finally managed to open a brief gateway into the Shroud.\n\nNow that we have established an initial psionic link, we will be able to access the Shroud through the §HContacts§! menu in the future. To make any kind of meaningful forays into this realm and meet the beings who dwell there, we will likely have to make use of special psionic emitters to extend our psychic reach."
