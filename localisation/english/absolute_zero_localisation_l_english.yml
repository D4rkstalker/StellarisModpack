 START_SCREEN_ABSOLUTE_ZERO:0 "Generations ago, when we were still a primitive empire, a sudden light from the sky blinded half the planet. Soon followed an immense gravitational wave that wreaked havoc on the planet's surface and its occupants. The phenomenon startled our civilisation and provoked us to reach into the skies.\n\nCenturies have passed in our quest to reach into the solar system, when something slammed into our home world. It was found to be a green glowing object like nothing seen before. After careful examination, the object turned out to be a highly advanced cache that must have been sent down by an alien species. Scientists studies the cache for decades to come, slowly propelling our technological advancements and discovering it's secrets."

### Absolute Zero ###

 origin_absolute_zero:0 "Absolute Zero"
 origin_absolute_zero_desc:0 "A neighbouring highly advanced empire sent a cache to our home world that had a mysterious timer elapsing on it. As generations passed, the yet primitive empire could not access the cache but studying it in the hopes of releasing the locked pandora's box."
 origin_tooltip_absolute_zero_effects:0 "- Your solar system starts with a §YNull star§! and a §Gcapital modifier§! that grants a §G25%§! physics, society, engineering and §R-30%§! food upkeep.\n- Your empire has received a §Ymysterious cache§!.\n- §RWARNING: Challenging Origin§!"

 escape_cache:0 "Cache Study"

 absolute_zero.1.name:0 "The Cache"
 absolute_zero.1.desc:0 "Generations ago, while we were still a primitive empire, an energy pulse suddenly travelled through our planet incurring quakes and sustaining moderate damage. It was disregarded as a strange phenomenon until couple months later a comet like object was approaching our home world. Upon impact it was discovered that it was a mysterious cache that could not be decrypted. Impenetrable in its design, it was studied for decades in search for a solution."

 absolute_zero.1.a:0 "Unbelievable... what's the status at the moment"

 THE_CACHE_1:0 "Accessing of the Cache"
 THE_CACHE_1_DESC:0 "The time is almost upon us, our technological advancement has reached a point where we can soon decrypt the cache and study whatever it holds. A small hidden hole was discovered on the cache which turned out to me a manual connection that enables for faster access probably when distant communication fails. We can now try to access the cache through our make-shift connector in the hopes of accessing it manually. This, however, is far from a perfect solution as our connector is rather slow considering the data held within. Consequently, it will take considerably longer to access it than originally intended."

 absolute_zero.2.name:0 "The Cache"
 absolute_zero.2.desc:0 "Access granted! There appears to be a timer but... something is strange... it seems, deliberate. There is more but the system appears to be in a limited state and requires power for normal operation. We'll need to try and supply power to figure out a way to access the systems. There is a good chance of finding something potentially revolutionary judging from what technology the cache comprises of itself."

 absolute_zero.2.a:0 "Power it and try to salvage whatever you can"

 THE_CACHE_2:0 "Studing the contents"
 THE_CACHE_2_DESC:0 "IT'S A WARNING. The timer is there to warn us of impending ruin that awaits... THE SUN! Our sun is dying or more specifically getting its energy nullified!?\nLooking at the set timer, we don't have much time remaining before it's drained of all energy and our planet is turned into a popsicle."

 absolute_zero.3.name:0 "The Cache"
 absolute_zero.3.desc:0 "Good news in the bad news. The advanced empire left us with some instructions of how we can save ourselves from this predicament. They left us blueprints of a beacon or satellite that can be placed near and around our sun to create a field of sort. The beacons draw power from the sun through radiation and convert it into a field that is drained instead of the sun, just more efficiently. The bad news is we must build it ourselves which will require resources and... time, time of which we are quickly running out of."

 absolute_zero.3.a:0 "A chance has been given... and on the stars! we will take it"

 THE_CACHE_3:0 "Field Beacon Network"
 THE_CACHE_3_DESC:0 "According to the blueprints and information that was passed on to us, the network of beacons must be activated before 2222. Otherwise the sun will react destructively, first cooking our planet and then turning it into a molten world. After this, last, spark what follows is extinguishing of the sun. Our planet will again be transformed into a frozen world leaving nothing after us but molten rock and ice."

 absolute_zero.4.name:0 "Field Beacon Network"
 absolute_zero.4.desc:0 "The framework is complete! All that remains is to start the construction of each beacon and finish the network that should generate the shield to our salvation."

 absolute_zero.4.a:0 "We much construct additional pylons!?"

 beacons_construction:0 "Construction of Beacons"
 beacons_construction_desc:0 "We must hurry and finish all 5 of the beacons around the sun before the timer runs out. Date of destruction: 2222"

 absolute_zero.5.name:0 "Field Beacon Network"
 absolute_zero.5.desc:0 "WE MADE IT JUST IN TIME! All the beacons are complete and field functioning."

 absolute_zero.5.a:0 "We are saved"

 absolute_zero.6.name:0 "Mysterious Empire"
 absolute_zero.6.desc:0 "We should be able to reverse engineer the network-based construction of beacons and harvest the energy instead… on healthy stars of course."

 absolute_zero.6.a:0 "Great! Initiate the project."

 MYSTERIOUS_EMPIRE_1:0 "Repurposing the Field Device"
 MYSTERIOUS_EMPIRE_1_DESC:0 "The undertaking of repurposing the field structure could prove to be very beneficial as a power generating device. It currently harvests the energy to produce a shield around the weakened sun, but we can build it around a healthy sun; and redesign it to extract the energy for us instead of the shield."

 absolute_zero.7.name:0 "Mysterious Empire and Null"
 absolute_zero.7.desc:0 "Success! We were able to repurpose the field structure into an energy generator. We can now place the structure on any regular star and put this technology to good use. We also finished the deep analysis of the cache but the only information that we found is vague references to research facilities on planets that were frozen due to this so-called Null star."

 absolute_zero.7.a:0 "Explore these facilities"

 mysterious_empire_sites:0 "Mysterious Empire Sites"
 mysterious_empire_sites_desc:0 "The advanced empire that was generous enough to point us in the right direction has also suffered from this occurrence and abandoned their now frozen over research facilities. We must reach these sites and retrieve as much information as possible."

 not_a_dying_star:0 "$TRIGGER_FAIL$Cannot build on stars that are soon to extinguish"

### Arch Sites ###

 absolute_zero_site_1:0 "Null Study Facility"
 absolute_zero_site_1_desc:0 "Airborne movement and signs of life have been detected on this planet after its freezing. It seems like a good starting point that's worth investigating for the research facilities."
 absolute_zero_sites.1.name:0 "Facility Found"
 absolute_zero_sites.1.desc:0 "We found a facility! After sending an expedition down to the surface, the source of the disturbance was automated drones flying around it. The drones appear to be still functional, being recharged by the near depleted maintenance station. Unfortunately, the drones are just flying around aimlessly possibly due to being out-of-date and the frozen over surface."
 absolute_zero_sites.2.name:0 "Extraction"
 absolute_zero_sites.2.desc:0 "Capture of the drone has proven to be fruitless as it self-destructed after being immobilised outside the facility. However, we did manage to gain access inside and it indeed is a research facility. Most of the inside is also frozen solid but extraction of data is still possible with potential losses due to the damage from the ice."
 absolute_zero_sites.3.name:0 "Strange Material"
 absolute_zero_sites.3.desc:0 "Data extraction complete. We managed to secure 67% of the data that was processed within these labs which is not ideal but a good result. According from what can be pieced together, the empire tried to handle some kind of material, named 'Null', that had radiation properties, or rather anti-radiation properties. This facility was meant to study this material, in the quest of reproducing it. The trials themselves were carried out in another facility but something didn't add up?"
 absolute_zero_sites.4.name:0 "Harvesting"
 absolute_zero_sites.4.desc:0 "Wait, No!? There is more. They have managed to find a way of harvesting the material, but the natural source is... still to be found. This can't be right."

 absolute_zero_site.1.a:0 "Try capturing it for processing"
 absolute_zero_site.2.a:0 "We'll take what we can get"
 absolute_zero_site.3.a:0 "Is that all? Try again or analise it further"
 absolute_zero_site.4.a:0 "Good start, it might come in handy"

 absolute_zero_site_2:0 "Null Reproduction Facility"
 absolute_zero_site_2_desc:0 "This was marked to be the material trails facility to reproduce it. Be careful! This one could be dangerous just judging from the nature of this facility. We have no idea what this 'Null' is capable of and what effects it may have on us and our equipment."
 absolute_zero_sites.5.name:0 "Entrance"
 absolute_zero_sites.5.desc:0 "This one is different, we succeeded in finding the facility but it's underground and sealed shut. The entrance door was the only way in but think as a blast door and abnormally cold."
 absolute_zero_sites.6.name:0 "Re-equip!"
 absolute_zero_sites.6.desc:0 "It's open! What... is happening. It's so cold and getting worse. Our temperatures are dropping rapidly, we must re-gear for this expedition. The process of energy being reduced appears to be gradual so we should be able to equip our suits with heating elements to counter act this effect, for a duration. This might be the cause of the Null material leaking out or maybe that's just its effects."
 absolute_zero_sites.7.name:0 "We are in"
 absolute_zero_sites.7.desc:0 "The containers are holding something that has the same characteristics as the strange star like pitch black object our small system is orbiting around. The system has locked the facility due to some malfunctions, but we should be able to lift them and extract whatever this empire managed to conclude."
 absolute_zero_sites.8.name:0 "Null"
 absolute_zero_sites.8.desc:0 "ON THE STARS!? What have they done... this... whole disaster is their doing. In the empire's mad pursuit to reproduce the Null resource, they have corrupted the central sun or rather, what was the sun. They have used a weapon of immense power infusing the little null material they possessed and started a reaction in the sun. The result... is known to us. They have succeeded but suffering huge collateral damage. Harvesting of the material was now possible and consequently engineered a weapon that can convert planet's core instead, for less devastating solar system affects. This however would most likely freeze the planet due to the null material on the inside."

 absolute_zero_site.5.a:0 "Try to get inside at all cost"
 absolute_zero_site.6.a:0 "Regear and tread carefully"
 absolute_zero_site.7.a:0 "Do what you need"
 absolute_zero_site.8.a:0 "Terrible... take the blueprints for safe keeping"

 absolute_zero_site_3:0 "Null Application Facility"
 absolute_zero_site_3_desc:0 "The unknown advanced empire knew a lot about Null and their technology was quite extraordinary. According to our general scans, this is the last facility they have developed in this system before their abandoning."
 absolute_zero_sites.9.name:0 "Lack of focus"
 absolute_zero_sites.9.desc:0 "This facility is relatively intact. We were able to get most of the data but ironically, it seems they didn't focus as much on this aspect of the research. Odd... There are solutions but they lack completeness and seem rushed from the beginning like they were trying to find something... else. Logically speaking, finding the best application for a material and possibilities in innovation would be the end goal."
 absolute_zero_sites.10.name:0 "Completed research"
 absolute_zero_sites.10.desc:0 "This is the completed technology we managed to extract from the database but most of it was just abstractly mentioned with no practical use. It still isn't clear why they are just breezing through these use cases and finding no way of implementing it."
 absolute_zero_sites.11.name:0 "Its true nature"
 absolute_zero_sites.11.desc:0 "We found something! A separate underground chamber where some other form of Null was studied. It didn't show up on our scans due to being underground from within, but they must have been in a hurry and left it open. Incredible... Null can reproduce by itself but in a saturated state. Once it is in contact with overwhelming energy, it starts to liquify and emit bright white light. As it can’t nullify the energy it just starts to absorb and releases it, pushing away from its consequently stabilising origin. It must however be in contact with mass of great energy for the process and reaction to continue; such as a sun. This explains the bright light centuries ago that blinded our home world. It was... the sun gets consumed and the reason why the unidentified empire had used it on the sun."
 absolute_zero_sites.12.name:0 "Communication"
 absolute_zero_sites.12.desc:0 "This research must have been done before they acquired a source for this material and then rushed after the solar system became inhospitable. There is also a functional communication device that might be able to establish contact with the empire in question."

 absolute_zero_site.9.a:0 "Strange, must be missing something"
 absolute_zero_site.10.a:0 "Worring... be careful"
 absolute_zero_site.11.a:0 "Ahh yes, now it all makes sense."
 absolute_zero_site.12.a:0 "Comms? Not sure if this is the best of ideas."
