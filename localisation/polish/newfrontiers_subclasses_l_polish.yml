 #Stage I
 boundless_ocean:0 "Boundless Ocean"
 boundless_ocean_desc:0 "This ocean world is completely devoid of land. The entire surface of the planet is covered with a solid ocean that is constantly in motion and rarely happens to be calm. Construction of buildings on this planet is possible only at a depth, under the water surface, or on specially built floating platforms.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 fog_world:0 "Fog World"
 fog_world_desc:0 "This wet world is covered with tropical jungles and marshy plains. Due to the activity of the local star and the unusual structure of the atmosphere, on this planet practically no cloud mass is formed in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Water circulation occurs in the form of continuous evaporation and condensation. Therefore, there is almost never rain and the entire planet is shrouded in thick fog.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 swamp_world:0 "Swamp World"
 swamp_world_desc:0 "This is the world of murky swamps, poisonous fumes and coal forests. There are almost no open sources of water on the planet, and the hydrosphere consists of endless swamps and flooded jungles with small muddy islets. Thanks to these conditions, this world is an excellent source of various gases of organic origin.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 karstic_world:0 "Karstic World"
 karstic_world_desc:0 "This planet was once the oceanic world, but as a result of changes in the activity of the star, the oceans boiled and evaporated, exposing the surface covered with deep scars and cavities. The entire planet is covered with giant canyons and a huge network of caves, which greatly simplify access to mineral resources. At the same time, the presence of such a huge number of hidden places will also attract many pirate and terrorist groups.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 glacial_world:0 "Glacial World"
 glacial_world_desc:0 "Much of the surface of this planet is covered with a huge ice shell. An incredible cold reigns in this world, and deadly snowstorms prevent the development of an already meager biosphere. The lifeless landscape of ice rocks occasionally alternates with weathered cliffs, opening access to rare minerals under the surface of the planet.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 dune_world:0 "Dune World"
 dune_world_desc:0 "This planet consists entirely of endless sandy sea of dunes with rare mountain ranges. In this world of endless desert, there are no open sources of water. Water can only be found in scarce polar caps and deep underground. Frequent sandstorms are very strong and destructive.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 boreal_world:0 "Boreal World"
 boreal_world_desc:0 "This planet not so long ago, by cosmic standards, survived the ice age and now its glaciers are retreating, baring the earth, previously bound by ice. Rough rivers and geothermal zones hidden in the depths of the retreating glaciers will serve as a good source of energy. The low temperature and not rich frozen lands are very harsh and only coniferous plants could survive here and become dominant in this world, competing with different mosses and lichens.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 underground_world:0 "Underground World"
 underground_world_desc:0 "Incredibly huge cavities and tunnels under the surface of this planet probably originated from the activity of the hydrosphere of the planet. Which once occupied a significant part of this world, but as a result of the sharp overheating of the surface, the raging streams of hot water created a giant network of underground caves. Surprisingly, but now under the earth there is a hidden world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a developing biosphere.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!\n\n------------ \n\n§WNot possible to terraform§! \n\n§WNot possible to bombard§!"
 young_world:0 "Young World"
 young_world_desc:0 "This planet is in the early stages of the formation of the biosphere. There is active volcanic activity on the planet, which creates more severe conditions for the settlers. However, the internal activity of the mantle significantly increases the energy potential of the planet.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 tempest_world:0 "Tempest World"
 tempest_world_desc:0 "This is a world of paradox, which is cooled by the heat of the local star. In fact, this is a common phenomenon in which the influence of a star and the gravitational position of the planet in the system causes its atmosphere to be in constant motion. At the same time incessant winds only accelerate the release of heat and cool the surface. This is a very harsh planet, whose landscape is polished by storms. The animal and plant world is extremely poor and exists only in caves and rare shelters.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 geothermal_world:0 "Geothermal World"
 geothermal_world_desc:0 "This world would be another frozen ball in an infinite space, but the incredible activity of the planet’s interior has done its job. Many areas of this planet are completely free of ice. Now it is a world of hot springs and frequent geysers. The animal and plant world of the planet is only awakening, but this is only the beginning.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 megaflora:0 "Megaflora"
 megaflora_desc:0 "The plant environment of this world has triumphed and shows its greatness in all. This planet is covered with forests and jungles of giant trees that can touch clouds with their crowns. Endless forests are a network and have a level structure. The animal world is also diverse, but often becomes food for predatory plants. Which are present in abundance on this planet.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 exotic_world:0 "Exotic World"
 exotic_world_desc:0 "This very unusual and bizarre world consists mainly of fungal life forms and huge amazing plants. Most of the planet is a marshy, wet terrain that develops into wild, fantastic forests. Despite its beauty and imaginary attraction, this is a very dangerous world. In the atmosphere there are always poisonous spores, and on the surface almost every plant or animal is deadly dangerous.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 
 sulfur_world:0 "Sulfur World"
 sulfur_world_desc:0 "This is a molten and constantly geologically active world, the main composition of which consists of various silicate rocks and sulfur compounds. Huge volcanism on this world contributes to frequent changes in the relief, and due to sulfur compounds ejected by volcanic eruptions, this world acquires various shades of yellow, white, red, black and green on its surface. Despite strong volcanism, this world has a very thin atmosphere, full of sulfur dioxide, so that, as a rule, local volcanoes eject the magma of the planet directly into space, something falls back on the planet in the form of molten sulfur rain, or wander outside the planets going to free flight."
 greenhouse_world:0 "Greenhouse World"
 greenhouse_world_desc:0 "This is a world with not an easy fate, with which time has played a bad joke. Sometime in the past, these worlds could be inhabited, but as the star around which they rotate grew, the temperature of the world grew, causing liquid water to evaporate, and with it more and more releasing greenhouse gases from the crust of the planet. Over time, the greenhouse effect turns the planet into a greenhouse world, in which the atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulfur dioxide. The surface temperature on such planets reaches fifty degrees Celsius, forcing whole mountains to melt, so the landscape of the planet's surface often changes. Also, a civilization could bring the planet to the greenhouse world, which actively exploited fossil fuels, causing a strong greenhouse effect."
 methane_world:0 "Methane World"
 methane_world_desc:0 "The atmosphere of this gloomy world consists of nitrogen and methane-ethane compounds, which very often precipitate on the surface, forming vast lakes."
 planetoid:0 "Planetoid"
 planetoid_desc:0 "This is a minor or dwarf planet having enough mass to form a shape close to spherical under the influence of gravity."
 ice_planetoid:0 "Ice Planetoid"
 ice_planetoid_desc:0 "This small or dwarf planet consists primarily of frozen H2O."
 frozen_ocean:0 "Frozen Ocean"
 frozen_ocean_desc:0 "Cold world covered with a thick crust of ice, under which there may be water in a liquid state or viscous convection ice."
 scorched_world:0 "Scorched World"
 scorched_world_desc:0 "This planet has migrated towards the central star of the system over time. Originally a flourishing world, radiative loss of atmosphere from close proximity to its central star has reduced it to a partially melted cinder."
 
 #New - Stage II
 ice_world:0 "Ice World"
 ice_world_desc:0 "Under the frozen surface of this icy world lies a hidden network of giant ice caves and oceans penetrating deep into the planetary crust. This amazing, but structurally unstable world has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a poor but fully developed biosphere.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!\n\n------------ \n\n§WNot possible to terraform§! \n\n§WNot possible to bombard§!"
 dust_world:0 "Dust World"
 dust_world_desc:0 "This extreme arid world has undergone severe degredation of the soil layer due to continuous, uncontrolled wind erosion. Mighty winds grind down mountains and occasionally raise huge dust storms that rage across the planetary surface, plunging the sky into a rusty twilight.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 oasis_world:0 "Oasis World"
 oasis_world_desc:0 "This desert paradise is dominated by a single ocean, which occupies 15% of the surface. The rest of the planet is covered by extensive desert biomes hidden mostly in rain shadow. Vegegation abounds on the coast of this great body of water, which has, over time, managed to penetrate some distance into the desert interior.\n\nType: §Gparadise§!"
 salt_world:0 "Salt World"
 salt_world_desc:0 "Once dominated by large, cool oceans, this world had both a humid climate and rich biosphere. Then an unknown cataclysm, possibly related to changes in the activity of its home star, caused the oceans to mostly evaporate. The little remaining moisture is now concentrated into extremely salty brine seas, and instead of oceans, half the surface is covered with endless salt flats suitable for only extremophile organisms.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 steppe_world:0 "Steppe World"
 steppe_world_desc:0 "The geological activity of this very old world has long ago ceased, with long-term erosion causing former mountain ranges to essentially vanish over the eons. The entire surface is now covered with endless grassy meadows, fertile prairies, and windblown steppes.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 snow_world:0 "Snow World"
 snow_world_desc:0 "This arctic world has a saturated hydrosphere that often precipitates as vigorous snowfall at all latitudes, with heavy snowstorms occuring frequently across the surface. Despite this, the planet is quite aesthetically pleasing, and is regarded as particularly suitable for winter recreation.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 antarctic_world:0 "Antarctic World"
 antarctic_world_desc:0 "This continental world once had oceans completely bound by endless ice shelves. As a result of a long period of warming, most of the oceanic surface is now free of ice, with remaining large shelves at the poles calving frequently to form giant icebergs that can reach several kilometers in diameter.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 temperate_zone:0 "Temperate Zone"
 temperate_zone_desc:0 "This cold world has a thin temperate equatorial region with conditions suitable for agriculture. Glacial retreat in this area has also exposed numerous surface mineral deposits.\n\nType: §Gparadise§!"
 cold_desert:0 "Cold Desert"
 cold_desert_desc:0 "A world of constant frosts and a weak hydrosphere, this planet is nearly barren. The cold rocky surface is inhospitable to even the most hardy of agricultural crops.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 pangea:0 "Pangea"
 pangea_desc:0 "The tectonic plates and continental masses of this world are currently assembled into one supercontinent. Although the coastal regions are a thriving paradise, the interior, far from the fertile river valleys near the coast, consists mainly of dry steppe and sun-scorched arid biomes stretching thousands of kilometers. Violent weather and hurricane force winds in the deep interior are deadly to the unprepared visitor.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 atoll_world:0 "Atoll World"
 atoll_world_desc:0 "While tectonics did not allow the formation of large continents on this world, it was nonetheless covered in massive undersea volcanoes constantly forming islands. Over the eons, many of these volcanic islands eroded and became home to megacorals, forming the distinctive giant atolls that cover the surface. Distributed almost evenly from pole to pole, the giant coral islands of this world are a true tropical paradise.\n\nType: §Gparadise§!"
 algic_seas:0 "Algic Seas"
 algic_seas_desc:0 "A world of great beauty, this planet is covered in supercolonies of algae that migrate across the oceans, painting them with vivid red and green hues. Acids excreted from some species of algae native here have unique healing properties that can be applied across several medical domains.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 death_world:0 "Death World"
 death_world_desc:0 "Outwardly this is a planet of captivating tropical beauty. But beneath the outworld appearance and riches of this planet is a world out to kill you at every turn. Constant competition in the biosphere has forced everything from fungi to trees to develop deadly countermeasures and predatory baiting mechanisms. Settlers who can adapt to the planet, offering them a thousand horrifying ways to die, will be some of the most enduring warriors in the galaxy.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 monsoon_world:0 "Monsoon World"
 monsoon_world_desc:0 "Orbital and geographic features of this world have created rapid and sustained seasonal changes in wind direction. Rapid heating of the land in summer causes large-scale irrigation and flooding from inward moving monsoon rains, while the winters are fairly dry as air flows to the sea. This world would be almost ideal if not for the numerous large hurricanes that form in the late summer as the oceans warm.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 ancient_world:0 "Ancient World"
 ancient_world_desc:0 "Many millions of years ago, this world was the cradle of some forgotten precursor civilization, their identity remaining a mystery to this day. Where once stood an ecumenopolis, life has reclaimed the planet. The remains of giant buildings peak out from the dense forests, while oceans have covered entire city districts once protected by colossal dams that have long since failed.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 industrial_graveyard:0 "Industrial Graveyard"
 industrial_graveyard_desc:0 "Once a centre of industry and the arts inhabited by countless billions, this world was abandoned entirely after some unknown disaster, with the infrastructure wasting away over geographic time. Air pollution from old technological catastrophies and chemical poisoning of the water table has made this planet largely incapable of supporting advanced life.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 volcanic_world:0 "Volcanic World"
 volcanic_world_desc:0 "The cause of the global catastrophe that destroyed this world remains a mystery. Perhaps a consequence of some disastrous technological accident, or perhaps some natural cataclysm of cosmic scale, this dying world is now almost completely uninhabitable. The nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, while heavily polluted with volcanic particulate matter, is still vaguely suitable for breathing. On a few pathetic pieces of land, unique and highly adaptable forms of life continue to find a way to survive.\n\nType: §Rextremal§!"
 
 carbon_world:0 "Carbon World"
 carbon_world_desc:0 "A true anomaly, this world is composed mainly of carbon instead of the usual silicate rocks and metals. Hydrocarbon seas stretch among coal mountain ranges and graphene plains, with giant diamond crystals jutting into the sky and creating alien landscapes. Despite the comfortable conditions of this world, it is deprived of oxygen and water necessary for the formation and sustainment of typical forms of life."
 hot_barren_world:0 "Hot Barren World"
 hot_barren_world_desc:0 "A hot barren world, with little to no atmosphere, this planet is too close to the central star of the system. Drastic changes in temperature are present with unbearable radiative heat during the day, and near absolute zero temperatures at night."
 ammonia_world:0 "Ammonia World"
 ammonia_world_desc:0 "The atmosphere of this wonderous planet consists of nitrogen and oxygen with an abundance of gaseous ammonia, while the surface is cold enough to sustain liquid ammonia lakes and oceans. The unique life that has formed here uses ammonia as its primary cellular component instead of water."
