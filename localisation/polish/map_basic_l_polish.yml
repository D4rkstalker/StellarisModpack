 personality_map_insidious_opportunists:0 "Insidious Opportunists"
 personality_map_insidious_opportunists_desc:0 "Insidious Opportunists are superficially cordial, which belies their true nature as ambitious manipulators who fear costs of conflict, and thus will instead make 'friends' only to further their own self-interest.

 personality_map_total_nutcases_desc:0 "Total nutcases, if you ask the precursors and fallen empires that have been watching them. But they've never done anything - yet - that would justify their complete eradication as a species. They are more than a bit strange.

 personality_map_princes_of_madness:0 "Princes of Madness"
 personality_map_princes_of_madness_desc:0 "They're undeniably mad, these Princes of Madness. But perhaps under the insanity is some sort of logic and even a sense of morality....

 personality_map_outcast_pariahs:0 "Outcast Pariahs"
 personality_map_outcast_pariahs_desc:0 "There is simply no polite way to put it. Outcast Pariahs are ugly. Or, at the least, others find them ugly. Yet, they have learned to embrace this ugliness. They are a society that values strength and honor, courage and power and deal fairly with those are fair to them in return, whether as friend or foe."
 personality_map_surgeons_of_beauty:0 "Surgeons of Beauty"
 personality_map_surgeons_of_beauty_desc:0 "Surgeons of Beauty are obsessed with the power of beauty. To them, any blemish, any flaw, any problem can be solved with technology, from plastic surgery to cosmetics and perfumes. To them, ‘beauty in the eye of the beholder’ is a lie - there is no such thing as natural beauty, and beauty can always be improved on.

 personality_map_quiet_cultists_desc:0 "This insular group simply wishes to be left alone. They are peaceful. They are true believers. They worship and are happy. There is nothing wrong with them.

 personality_map_xenial_merrymakers_desc:0 "Xenial Merrymakers are a happy lot. To them, there is an inherent mirth of the universe - there can be no suffering after all if one is happy. Their society is one founded on the principles of compassion, generosity, hospitality, partying, a love of fun and friendship with one's fellows, and, of course, getting drunk on the best booze there is in the galaxy."
 personality_map_valiant_hearts:0 "Valiant Hearts"
 personality_map_valiant_hearts_desc:0 "Peace through war. An oxymoronic statement, but Valiant Hearts truly believe in it. They have seen the devastation and cruelty that war can bring.

They know that if there is ever to be universal peace and harmony, one must prepare for and sometimes bring about war."
