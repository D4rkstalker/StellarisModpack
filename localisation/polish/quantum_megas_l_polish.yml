quantum_wormhole_node: "Quantum Gateway"
quantum_wormhole_node_DESC: "This is a stable two-way subspace connection, created via catapulting a fleet from the $quantum_catapult_3$."

QUANTUM_WORMHOLE_GALACTIC: "$quantum_wormhole_node$"
QUANTUM_WORMHOLE_DESC: "This system contains a §Y$quantum_wormhole_node$§! connecting this system to a §Y$quantum_catapult_3$§!."

quantum_catapult_4: "Active $quantum_catapult_3$"
quantum_catapult_4_DESC: "This activated $quantum_catapult_3$ has established a stable $quantum_wormhole_node$. In exchange it loses its ability to catapult ships in favor of keeping the $quantum_wormhole_node$ open at a great energy upkeep cost."

quantum_events.1.name: "$quantum_wormhole_node$ Connection Established"
quantum_events.1.desc: "We have successfully established a §Y$quantum_wormhole_node$§! connection between our §Y$quantum_catapult_3$§! and the §Y[event_target:quantum_gateway_target.GetName]§! System. Any space vessel, friend or foe, may use it to travel instantly between the two endpoints."
quantum_events.1.a: "The floodgates have opened!"
quantum_events.1.b: "Are we there yet?"
quantum_events.1.c: "We are already there."

quantum_events.2.name: "$quantum_wormhole_node$ Closed"
quantum_events.2.desc: "All active §Y$quantum_wormhole_node$s§! outgoing from our §Y$quantum_catapult_3$§! located in the §Y[from.GetName]§! System have vanished. They can no longer be used for instant travel. The fleet catapulting abilities of the §Y$quantum_catapult_3$§! have also been restored."
quantum_events.2.a: "Shutdown sequence successful."
quantum_events.2.b: "Gates closed."
quantum_events.2.c: "Nobody gets in."

quantum_catapult_dummy: "Deactivate $quantum_wormhole_node$"
quantum_catapult_dummy_DESC: "Reverts the $quantum_catapult_3$ back to its normal function. This will take some time however to make sure no catastrophic subspace backleash happens."
