 ag_gamma.72.desc.part1:0 "After analyzing a large amount of ancient data obtained from §H[ag_ancient_gamma_shielded_world.GetName]§!, our [Root.GetScienceDepartment] and [Root.GetArchaeologyDepartment] found the design data of a giant space station, which is a product of a project called \"Void\" in the records of ancient civilizations, numbered 0279. \n\nCombined with the previous reports of our fleet fighting with the ancient defense system, we believe that this giant space station is very similar to the previous giant space station located in the center of §H[ag_ancient_gamma_star.GetName]§!, and also has a certain degree of similarity with some smaller space stations controlled by the ancient defense system. Our [Root.GetArchaeologyDepartment] believes that this ancient space station may have many variants, and what we have obtained so far is only one of them. According to the records of the Ancient Civilization, these space stations were once used as some kind of fortress to protect some key nodes on the hyperplane network, but it seems that with the development of certain events within the Ancient Civilization, these nodes became more important to them decrease and decline, the Ancient Civilizations invested less and less resources in maintaining them. In the end, most of these nodes were completely submerged in the long history, most of the information about them has been lost, our [Root.GetArchaeologyDepartment] can only be inferred that they are related to galaxies outside our galaxy, but no more details can be known. \n\nAccording to the design information we have obtained, our [Root.GetScienceDepartment] believes that it is completely feasible to restore such a giant fortress, but the construction of the entire fortress is far beyond our technological level. We must rely on the construction facilities of the Ancient Civilization to complete this work."

 ag_gamma.73.desc.part2:0 "These $ag_construction_section$ are currently under the protection of complex ancient security systems, and these security systems have not undergone incomplete dismantling, so there is no loophole that can help us break through, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] has not found any way to break through them. However, based on the characteristics of the ancient security system in §H[ag_ancient_gamma_star.GetName]§!, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] has designed a method that can bypass some security measures to control the Construction Sections, although this method can only allow us to use some existing ancient ship design models, and the entire operation process is quite complicated, at least one $constructor$ is required to be manually adjusted around at any time. \n\nIn order to obtain partial control of $ag_construction_section$s, we need to send a $constructor$ to manually install our operating programs in one of those $ag_construction_section$s."
