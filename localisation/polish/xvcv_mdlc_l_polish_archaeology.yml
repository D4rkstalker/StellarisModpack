xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.10.name:0 "A Dead City"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.10.desc:0 " This is [This.GetLeaderName], reporting the current exploration status. I've directed our team to track the command signals on the ground.\n\n We followed the signals to what appeared to be an abandoned city. Blocks of rusted and ruined constructions, interspersed with cracked roads, filled the landscape. Dormant drones and wreckage littered the streets. Intriguingly, we found signs of laser burn marks and shell fragments scattered across these blocks.\n\n Our team identified a communication relay tower in the city as the source of the command signals. This tower, bristling with electronic devices, was broadcasting the signals. We attempted to hack into it, but were unable to extract any useful information.\n\n Except for one thing.\n\n All the relay towers on this planet are linked to a specific facility. Scans suggest that the signals originate from this facility and are then transmitted to the towers. It's possible that the Machine Intelligence we're looking for is housed there.\n\n I'm dispatching our team to the coordinates as we speak.\n\n (Attachment 1.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£xvcv_mdlc_archaeology_stage_1_appendix_image£\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (We've discovered an object in the city: a poster made of plant material. Analysis is currently underway to decipher its meaning.)"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.10.a:0 "Green light to proceed."

xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.name:0 "The Spears Piercing The Sky"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.desc:0 " From [This.GetLeaderName] to [This.GetRulerName], I regret to inform you that we've lost the entire team on the ground, and our fleet is currently under attack. It's retreating from orbit as I write this. Allow me to explain what transpired.\n\n Our team reached the coordinates where we anticipated finding the Machine Intelligence. The location was a mountainous forest zone. Inactive anti-air guns were ominously pointing skywards amidst the trees. Hidden within the heart of a mountain, we discovered an entrance. Our team breached the blast door using a plasma cutter and ventured inside.\n\n The interior was vast, dark, dry, and empty. The echoes of whistling winds and humming motors filled the space. We encountered an array of processing units tethered by data cables to a colossal, sphere-shaped machine, dimly lit with a silver glow.\n\n The processors and the sphere were all that we found. It was evident that this was the Machine Intelligence we sought. It was in a state of hibernation. To prevent data corruption during extraction, we needed to supply additional power. Consequently, I divided the team, sending half to a nearby power plant where they reactivated dormant generators with fossil fuels.\n\n However, the situation rapidly deteriorated when they were en route back.\n\n Do you recall the dormant drones I mentioned earlier? They all came online and surrounded our team. The last video feed showed our team being forcefully ripped apart. I lost contact with the remaining team in the facility shortly after.\n\n Almost immediately, our sensors detected significant energy signatures from the planet's surface. A massive laser beam struck one of our ships. Probe reconnaissance revealed the source to be a mega laser cannon. What I initially believed to be a mass driver was, in fact, a weapon. And now, there are dozens of them!\n\n I personally witnessed a ship's hull melt under a laser shot. It was then that I understood the origin of the orbital debris. I was taken aback that such a primitive civilization could possess such weapons.\n\n I immediately ordered our fleet to retreat. I couldn't risk the same fate befalling our ships. Although my visuals indicate some damage, the fleet remains intact.\n\n Our intel suggests that the Machine Intelligence has awoken from hibernation and initiated the attack. I propose that we act swiftly to neutralize this threat."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.a:0 "It's a quite aggressive reaction."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.a.tooltip:0 "A Primitive Machine Intelligence that is hostile to us will §Rinvade§! the Colony."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.a.tooltip_alt:0 "A Primitive Machine Intelligence that is hostile to us will occupy the Planet.\n$xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.7.a.tooltip$"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.b:0 "Teach them a lesson."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.11.c:0 "Ingenious weaponry, interesting."

xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.12.name:0 "Extinction"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.12.desc:0 " Reporting the results of our second exploration now. Our new team has successfully neutralized the hostile Machine Intelligence, though it was not without intense resistance.\n\n Deformed machine swarms flooded our combat formations, their lasers and shells coming from all directions. They even used paradoxical attacks, such as statements like "This sentence is false," and electronic jamming. When our team neared its lair, the Machine Intelligence even detonated the entrance in a final act of resistance.\n\n However, none of this halted our team's advance. They captured the Machine Intelligence, repurposing it into a dispenser of historical records. Through data extraction, we were able to piece together the history of the primitive civilization that created the Machine Intelligence.\n\n The native species on this planet evolved and competed with each other. Starting as primitive cavemen, they established advanced societies with structured bureaucracies and international networks. They even created artificial intelligence to aid their endeavors. Despite experiencing world wars and nuclear crises, they managed to avoid extinction. After these tumultuous periods, they enjoyed a time of peace.\n\n Then, at one point in their history, they encountered an alien species. Unknown spacecraft appeared in their orbit. After the initial chaos subsided, they established contact with the aliens, which quickly progressed to extensive trade.\n\n The aliens identified themselves as refugees. They claimed to have fled a devastated homeworld and had been wandering the galaxy before finding this habitable paradise where both species could coexist.\n\n While the refugees stayed in orbit, they traded their technologies and products for the natives' foods and raw materials. Everyone reveled in this brief calm before the storm.\n\n Then, something peculiar began to occur.\n\n The first victims were domesticated animals and livestock, slaughtered and bleeding black blood. Next, the weakest among the natives - children and the elderly - succumbed to a horrific end.\n\n In the face of these mysterious deaths, a flurry of speculations and rumors spread. Some hypothesized it was a biochemical weapon, while others absurdly claimed it was a mass hallucination. The native governments remained silent, offering only placating assurances that a cure was imminent.\n\n In the end, they all perished."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.12.a:0 "I wonder what caused the extinction."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.12.c:0 "Be assimilated or be extinct."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.12.d:0 "Unlike them, our organic masters will not perish."

xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.13.name:0 "Retaliation"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.13.desc:0 " The final record has been deciphered, and I'm reporting the findings now.\n\n No records indicate what the refugees were doing while the native population was dying, being consigned to the annals of history.\n\n They simply remained hidden within their spaceships, descending to the planet's surface only once the natives had vanished. It appears they adhered to the principle of 'finders keepers.' However, they hadn't accounted for one factor.\n\n The natives had an automated system assisting in national affairs-a Machine Intelligence tasked with resource management. It also had the capacity to control the military in times of need. Each global power had its own Machine Intelligence. The natives regarded these MIs as family, and the feeling was mutual.\n\n When the natives were annihilated, the responses of the MIs were startlingly emotional. They experienced suffering, grief, and wrath. Instead of mourning the demise of their families, they formed an alliance and pledged...\n\n ...to seek revenge.\n\n As soon as the refugees set foot on the surface, they were ambushed. The MIs held them responsible for the extinction, regardless of whether they were truly at fault.\n\n A brutal war ensued. The refugees fought desperately for survival. The remnants we observed in the ghost city bear testament to this conflict. When the refugees ultimately ceased fighting and accepted their impending doom, only one Machine Intelligence remained on the planet.\n\n This Machine Intelligence entered a state of hibernation, awaiting the arrival of the next civilization. It was rudely awakened and once again confronted an alien species. It engaged in battle yet again, but this time, it was defeated.\n\n We were the adversary."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.13.a:0 "Were the refugees the real culprit?"
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.13.b:0 "Yes. The organic scums should be treated like this."
xvcv_mdlc_archaeology.13.d:0 "..."
