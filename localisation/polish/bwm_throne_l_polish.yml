Our scientists have been examining the ship's database and deem the vessel relatively safe. The AI core thankfully seems to have never been initialized. Adding to the mystery of the [bwm_ring_system.GetName] system, all records of the ringworld builders have been wiped from the database.

Their latest proposal to gain deeper understanding involves a thorough study of the ships framework and its numerous inner processes. It is needless to say that while these studies are in progress it would greatly hamper the ships overall performance, which might pose a significant reduction of our empires naval capabilites.\n\nIn the name of progress our scientists may blindly accept many risks but on the other hand should we risk to omit this opportunity?"
