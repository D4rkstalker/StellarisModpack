It is surprising to our [Root.GetScienceTeam] that a considerable number of these observations target isolated black holes or barren voids, and even a certain number of coordinates are in intergalactic voids. Even at coordinates in our galaxy, most of them are, and astronomical observations have also shown that there are no hyperlanes that can reach these locations.\n\nHowever, among a large number of observations, there are still some that have caught the attention of our [Root.GetScienceDepartment]. These are the coordinates of some celestial bodies with obvious anomalies around them. Astronomical observations show that some of the coordinates also contain some ancient stars, and there may be unstable hyperlanes near these coordinates, and the coordinates pointed to by these data are quite vague, and further research is needed to obtain more relevant information."

However, these areas have one feature in common - astronomical observations suggest that they contain some kind of unnatural structure, and they are mentioned many times in the records of ancient astronomical observatories.\n\nDue to the loss of ancient data and changes in the relative positions of celestial bodies, as well as the influence of some unnatural interstellar dust and gravitational effects, we cannot directly locate the positions of these regions through astronomical observations, and even those regions containing stars cannot be compared with any of us. It matches the known stars on the star chart, they are like ghosts hiding in the void, haunting our [Root.GetScienceDepartment], maybe we can only unveil the mystery of these areas when we have more advanced astronomical observation methods in the future."
