And guide us they did. With their advice, we made great technological strides, quickly mastering electricity, then atomic power, and then crude spaceflight. Under the tutelage of the Elders, we have constructed our first hyperdrives. Now they have invited us to join them as junior partners in their galactic ambitions."

Scarcely sooner than they'd established their intended colonies, we arrived on craft fitted with newly devloped FTL drives to establish a much closer relationship with the colonies than any of the colonists had anticipated.\n\nIn that time, the world unification just beginning when the colonists departed has been perfected, although at the cost of decades of inward-facing politics and development priorities to bring all the peoples of our homeworld on board.

 ### Capitalistic

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_libertarian_freehold_desc:0 "This government is the result of an extreme experiment in privatization where all functions of government were contracted out to various businesses. Only the legislature and courts remain as government entities, with the highest judge in the empire having assumed certain executive powers by default."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE:0 "Chief Arbitrator"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_LIBERTARIAN_FREEHOLD:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. Then an innovation in statecraft took hold: we let more nimble and efficient businesses start doing the government's work. Now our planetary government mostly serves to set the standards for private contractors and to see justice done when anyone's rights are violated."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_anarcho_capitalism:0 "Anarcho-Capitalism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_anarcho_capitalism_desc:0 "This government is theoretically no government at all, as all functions of a normal government have been distributed to various competing private entities, even law-enforcement and justice. Only a single position, a dispute-resolver of last resort, remains as anything resembling an officer of a sovereign state."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ANARCHO_CAPITALISM:0 "In the early days, our people were imprisoned and extorted by states. We groaned under the violent demands of kings and bureaucrats. Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses, charities, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The revolution saw states swept aside and replaced with a variety of voluntary, competitive dispute resolution organizations and covenant communities. Only one vestigial position of government remains to provide a light moderating force."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_neofuedalism:0 "Corporate Neofeudalism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_neofuedalism_desc:0 "This government didn't merely contract out its functions to businesses, it is the result of decentralizing government to regional or local scale and running states as businesses, under the forward-thinking guidance of a new aristocracy of wealth. On a global scale, the corporate overlords entrust foreign affairs and the military to a hired agent."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_CORPORATE_NEOFUEDALISM:0 "Our people were once mismanaged by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their idiotic commitment to 'equality.' Only with time did we learn the virtue of inequality and the power of innovative disruption. The ultimate disruption in the realm of a politics beholden to inept corporate interests was to cut the government down to size, and then to cut out the middlemen and run governments like businesses, with our best and brightest entrepreneurs at the helm."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_proprietary_franchise:0 "Proprietary Franchise"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_proprietary_franchise_desc:0 "This government is actually a family business that has swollen to the point that it dominates whatever vestigial state nominally governs society.

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_PROPRIETARY_FRANCHISE:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by inefficient republics and pompous royal dynasties. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of merchant families grew steadily. Eventually one cunning and ruthless family business managed to corner the market in nearly every sector and become the de facto rulers of the world. States still operate, other businesses still serve niche markets, but everyone knows better than to disturb the family's bottom line. It's just better to let their money keep rolling in."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_entrepreneurial_council:0 "Entrepreneurial Council"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_entrepreneurial_council_desc:0 "This government is primarily concerned with managing its ideal of a competitive and fair market economy. Social mobility is precariously fluid, but those who succeed in business exert great power."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_ENTERPRISE_COM_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_ENTERPRISE_COM$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTREPRENEURIAL_COUNCIL:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. The top became too heavy to be held up, though, and eventually nimble and hungry private enterprises became more influential and powerful than any state by virtue of their innovations. Today, a council of entrepreneurs acts as global referees for business practices to ensure that the freedom to innovate neither overwhelms customers and employees nor crowds out competition."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_MERCH_COMMON:0 "This society sees commercial success and overall social merit as inextricably linked."
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_MERCH_START_COMMON:0 "In the early days, our original republican liberty was overrun by tyrannical lords and empires. Gradually, as global trade increased, the importance of merchants and industry became impossible to ignore, and it could be said that gold ruled the world."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_merchant_republic:0 "Merchant Republic"

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_constitutional_plutocracy_desc:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_MERCH_COMMON$ For this reason, its members see nothing wrong with public offices and candidacies for representative elections being open to the highest bidder. Indeed, they find it eminently reasonable."

The Overmind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] from the several different but subordinate perspectives that ultimately constituted its cooperative self. We moved as one, building shelters for the drones, developing industry, researching new technologies and harnessing the resources of the land.\n\nThrough the assistance of regional sub-minds to handle mundane tasks, we grew to encompass the entire world. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but unlike the sub-minds, were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Overmind as any of its other instruments.\n\nAs we achieved complete dominion over [GetHomeWorldName], the Overmind became aware of other worlds, orbiting other suns. In conference with its internal diversity of consciousnesses, the Overmind came to a conclusion: the [GetName] must grow further. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances between the stars."

Many European nations created companies like this in the early age of exploration and colonization. These nations did not actually have the funds to finance colonial ventures nor the administrative capacity to govern distant lands, so they created these companies as a form of indirect control over extraction: by selling stock in the company, they could raise the initial money (with the promise of a return to the initial investors) while also taxing all the trade between the colonies they created and the mother country.\n\nSince early game Stellaris is set in a new 'age of exploration and colonization,' this seemed like a good fit for a civic with its own playstyle. It puts you in the role of a mixed private/public entity called a §Y$lrsk_gov_var_gov_colonial_charter_board$§!, a kind of public holding corporation that 'charters' colonial companies. The way this works is: when you obtain a subject, you should eventually be given a choice to turn them into a §Y$preset_lrsk_gov_var_subject_chartered_company$§! subject. $LRSK_SPECSUBJ_MENU_NOTICE$ You get §G+10%§! £trade_value£ Trade Value (max §G+150%§!) and §G-5%§!
