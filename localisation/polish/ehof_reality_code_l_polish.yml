The ship's propulsion drive collapsed and it laid dormant for exactly 6 hours.\n\nThankfully, the secondary power core did not get damaged and activated shortly after the energy flash, securing the life support system of the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§!.\n\n6 hours after the initial flash, bizarre events began to take place onboard the vessel. The crew reports describe how all the systems began to reactivate, but remained uncontrollable. The monitors inside the ship began to display enigmatic but ordered patterns.\n\nIt was as if the ship was being possessed. Automatic doors closed and opened in a pattern, synchronous to the one on the monitors.\n\n6 more hours passed and the ship's systems collapsed again, but this time entirely, including the secondary power core. At first, this seemed to be the end of the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§!, but the blackout lasted only 10 seconds, after which the vessels systems began to reactivate.\n\nAfter the event, the §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§! was back under control and the crew began to examine the vessel, only to find that it was entirely unharmed.\n\nThe $ehof_eps$ have not manifested since and the ships log has no record of this strange 12 hours period, as if nothing happened at all.\n\nThis phenomenon must be investigated further"

The code sequence is capable of infecting and possessing logical structures, like vessels.\n\nThe energy intensity of the code sequence leads to the revelation that the blackout on §H[ehof_code_fleet.GetName]§! was not the result of the vessel being hit by the energy flash, the ship simply could not handle the immense complexity of the information, leading to a full blackout.\n\nThe sequence was in fact responsible for the strange behavior on the ship, including the manifestation of the code sequence itself, as visual information on the monitors or mechanical information with the doors.\n\nThe initial use of the sequence and what it is even supposed to mean is unclear, but we were able to modify our science ships with $ehof_closed_modular$ and $ehof_ep$ scanners.\n\nThe $ehof_closed_modular$ are small, independently powered complexes, located in essential areas of our vessels and will function even after a full blackout of the main and secondary power cores. They are equipped with the ability to connect to specific sections of the ship and reactivate, while entirely cutting them from the main systems. With these complexes the ships will be able to operate again within an hour.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners, like the $ehof_closed_modular$ are also independently powered and are equipped with experimental information processing units, specifically designed for the $ehof_ep$. They will be able to retrieve the pattern and process it, without suffering from the blackout.\n\nWith this new technology, our science ships can now traverse the $ehof_cohesive$ systems safely and are ready for another transmission of the $ehof_ep$."

Inside this space a construct that appears to be the source, is located. It is shaped in the form of an octahedron, with a diameter of exactly 2.5 kilometers at it's biggest extent.\n\nThe entire space around the object appears to be wobbling for unknown reasons, as if the object is projecting some sort of force field. This would also explain why there is such a big empty space around the source in the first place.\n\nBased on surface scans, the surface is composed of a material of unknown composition. Thermal scans reveal an astonishing property of the object. Its thermal temperature is at almost absolute zero, in the orders of zeptokelvin, colder than black holes. At such a low temperature, the state of an object can almost be seen as frozen in time. How the construct can reach this temperature and for what reason is unknown. The same can be said for the force field it appears to generate.\n\nScanners cannot penetrate the surface and detect no signs of emitting radiation, only average field excitations, and weak fluctuations of the $ehof_ep$.

And it did.\n\nOn one of the surfaces of the object, an entrance manifested. The crew entered and found something inside that can only be described as a mechanism of incredible complexity.\n\nThey studied it for a long time, just to find out that this mechanism was an additional blockade for the real entrance, some kind of identification checkpoint. They needed advanced computational assistance to solve the mechanism, but were successful nonetheless and were granted access. Inside, they found a hyper-complex technological system.\n\nAfter an intense study of the system, they were still not entirely able to determine the initial function of the structure, but they've found out that it is not really the source of the $ehof_ep$, but serves as an amplifier and repeater for it. The sequence appears to get transmitted via gravielectromagnetic waves and at the edge of the solar system, through an unknown mechanism, enters some form of faster-than-light(ftl) travel.\n\nIt might be possible that the alien object, which is located at the edge of this solar system, the $ehof_gateway_disabled$, might have something to do with it.

Three things are necessary for the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ to react to the transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ and activate, to transport it throughout interstellar space.\n\nFirst, the gravielectromagnetic waves, which transport the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, need to possess a specific energy content. If the energy content differs even slightly, regardless if it is less or higher, the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ will not react to the transmission and neutralize the gravielectromagnetic wave. Second, the kind of wave, which transports the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, needs to be gravielectromagnetic. The reason for this appears to be that the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ won't get activated by other forms of radiation, with the same energy content necessary to activate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$. Third, the enigmatic pattern code sequence needs to be tuned perfectly to activate the $ehof_gateway_disabled$.

It is distinct from all the others, which are used simply for activating the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, turning them into $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$ and transporting the $ehof_epcs$ between $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$. For now, this unique manifestation seems to be without use for us, cause it is not entirely whole yet. Based on computational analysis, at least one or two more specific fragments are needed, for the completion of the sequence. What it is there for, is currently unknown. Other than an additional fragment of the unique $ehof_epcs$, we've also found out even more about the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$. We may be able to activate them and use them for travel between the wormhole-cohesive systems, but we actually still know almost nothing about how they work or who built them. The $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$ structure is of astonishing complexity, just like the amplifier objects. Similar to them, they appear to be somehow sentient, alive, not only based on their behaviors, but also the way they are constructed and structured. They appear to be mechanical constructs with a biologically inspired design. It is astonishing and difficult to comprehend. Why they are constructed that way is unknown, but it is amazing nonetheless. The crew of the drilling unit is preparing themselves to head back to the surface."

Based on the information extracted from the databases of the amplifiers, in general, only the origin itself appears to be capable of creating a connection between itself and other $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$. However, multiple amplifier objects, which work in unison, are also able to do it. At least six of them are needed for this, because only then can they create the entire master-code sequence.

What we already know is the following. The amplifiers are capable of creating quasi-negative mass for an unknown purpose and are using the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$ to communicate with each other. The signal through which they communicate, the $ehof_epcs$ code sequence, is transmitted via gravielectromagnetic waves until it reaches an $ehof_gateway_disabled$, which then either reacts to it or doesn't react to it. This depends on the frequency and amplitude of the $ehof_epcs$ and the intensity of the energy stored inside the gravielectromagnetic wave, which carries the $ehof_epcs$. If the $ehof_gateway_disabled$ does react, it transforms into an $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ and transmits the $ehof_epcs$ to the desired wormhole-cohesive system. The fundamental purpose for all this is still a mystery, but the investigation of the origin will hopefully reveal it to us. Thanks to the master-code sequence, we will now be able to create a connection between an $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ and the origin of the enigmatic pattern.\n\nOther than that, with the knowledge gathered inside the amplifiers and the study of the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$, we are now able to research the technology to manufacture sentient metal and create our own $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$!"

The structure is definitely not of natural origin and appears to be getting defended by a vessel we have not encountered before, the Stellar Eradicator.\n\nWe should proceed with caution, as it looks to be hostile and heavily armed!

There's no indication as to where it went or if it might return.\n\nRegardless, we can now resume our mission, the reason we came here to begin with. The spherical object which is probably the origin of the enigmatic pattern.\n\nVisual and thermal scans of the surface show that it's perpetually in motion and changing between many different states of matter. It is neither solid nor liquid nor gaseous nor a plasma. It is all of them at once! Even ultra high or ultra low energy states of matter appear to exist within the surface's composition, like Bose-Einstein-Condensates, degenerate matter and even photonic matter.\n\nThe surface is also glowing on its own from time to time, at different locations, probably because of the decay of photonic matter and the constant phase transitions. Based on our knowledge about the fabric of the amplifier objects and the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$, the surface could be made out of the same material as they are composed of. Sentient metal. Attempts to verify this hypothesis unfortunately prove futile, as the composition of the surface is impossible to determine with scanners, due to the constant and extremely rapid phase transitions. What's noteworthy is that it appears to possess specific colour schemes, that are the same almost all over construct. A gold-silver and orange. How all of this works is absolutely unknown.\n\nTwo circular shaped areas, which can only be defined as the 'poles' of this sphere, because perfect spheres don't have poles, are distinct from the main surface structure. They have a diameter of approximately 2 million kilometers and appear to be made out of a solid, crystalline material with a bronze-like colour. Unlike the rest of the surface, the poles are static and don't change in the slightest way. In the centers of these poles, some kind of large sigil, shaped in a similar form as the amplifiers and the sigils on the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, is located. It may be some sort of representative symbol of the creators of this construct, the amplifiers and the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$.\n\nJust like with the amplifier objects, the surface cannot be penetrated with scanners, but unlike them its temperature is not definable, due to the perpetually changing phases of the surface.\n\nAn entrance is not identifiable, if there is any, but it may be similar to the amplifier objects, whose entrances only 'manifest' under specific conditions.\n\nAn intense study of the structure will be necessary to determine its function and to find a way into it, which will probably be necessary to determine the function in the first place.

Their temperatures probably range in the orders of extremely low and extremely high temperatures.\n\nEvery form of equipment that would be used to even only touch the surface, would probably be destroyed in an instant. Instead, our researchers want to go with the approach of using the $ehof_epcs$. It was the key to get access to the amplifiers and the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, so it may be the key for $ehof_the_sphere$ as well. However, they will not just use any enigmatic pattern code sequence, but the master-code sequence. It is likely that, if the $ehof_the_sphere$ even reacts to the $ehof_epcs$ at all, it will be to the master-code sequence.\n\nDue to the immense size of $ehof_the_sphere$, a single transmitter will probably not be enough for it, in case that it might truly react to the $ehof_ep$. However, only one facility will be constructed to begin with. It will be a directional transmitter for the $ehof_epcs$ and emit the $ehof_ep$ onto the surface via gravielectromagnetic waves.\n\nConstruction of the facility can begin now."

After that, the researchers used gravielectromagnetic waves instead, as it was also necessary to use them for the $ehof_gateway_disableds$. This time, $ehof_the_sphere_named$ reacted, even if only for a short amount of time.

They aligned circularly from the center to the outside, forming a circle filled with evenly ordered notches.\n\nBased on the fact that 1 facility had 1 notch and 5 facilities have 216 notches, it can be determined that the number of notches increases with the power of three. The size of the notches themselves did not change.\n\nWith this rate of increase, it will take 126 facilities in total until the amount of notches and their alignment would cover the whole pole. Building an additional 110 of these expensive facilities would be an economical nightmare and our scientists are convinced that increasing the number until the whole pole is covered, would not lead to the manifestation of an entrance. They believe that the amount of signals emitted from the facilities alone is not enough, similar to how the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ do not react simply to the $ehof_epcs$, but only under specific conditions. Besides the quantity, the intensity, frequency and amplitude of the transmission is also important. The quantity and the quality of the transmission needs to be correct, to trigger the manifestation of an entrance.\n\nThe facilities will now begin to emit the $ehof_epcs$ master-code sequence with various intensities and configuration onto $ehof_the_sphere$, to verify this hypothesis."

With the right intensity and configuration, the notches merged into one large hole, with a diameter of 240 kilometers, and $ehof_the_sphere$ finally opened.\n\nOur scientists were even able to find out, that by applying the right intensity with a different number of facilities, increases or decreases the size of the entrance.
