    #First Time Complete Space Elevator (Regular Empire)
    pw_wonder.101.name: "To The Stars We Rise"
    pw_wonder.101.desc: "A great spire launches for the clouds of [ROOT.GetName] ending only on its outer atmosphere. Already the platforms of our recently built Space Elevator run up and down, carrying immigrants and emigrants; exports and imports.\nThe city sized launch complex provides a variety of jobs in transportation and logistics, but it also caries some concern on the surveillance of our planet borders.\n\nNevertheless it stands as monument to space logistics."
    pw_wonder.101.a: "We welcome the galaxy here!"
    pw_wonder.101.b: "Increase migration checks, just to to be sure."

    pw_wonder.102.desc: "A great spire launches for the clouds of [ROOT.GetName] ending only on its outer atmosphere. Already the platforms of our recently built Space Elevator run up and down, carrying drones and resources, output and input.\nThe district sized launch complex demands jobs in transportation and logistics that should keep our drones occupied. It also presents the minor concern that it is now easier for deviant drones to infiltrate our borders or to flee them.\n\nNevertheless it stands as monument to space logistics."
    pw_wonder.102.a: "We move trough the galaxy as We please."
    pw_wonder.102.b: "Every resource we need will be readily available here."

    pw_wonder.201.desc: "A myriad of experiments proposals has arrived at [ROOT.GetName] on the last fez months as the entire scientific community yearns to see what this newly built Particle Supercollider can reveal.\nSpanning a circumference that could encompass our largest cities and draining twice as much power, the Supercollider is capable of positron collisions never before observed in controlled experiments and more importantly, it is capable of putting the most delirious theories of field manipulation, quantum entanglements and rope theory to the test.\n\nWho knows what lurks behind the veil of theory?"

    pw_wonder.301.desc: "A city district of [ROOT.GetName], completely secluded behind a holographic dome and protected by a powerful force field. It is finally complete.\nUtilizing hundreds of thousands of sensor, cameras and actuators our scientists can elaborate many different societal experiments at a city scale. This alone can advance our understanding of societal mechanism and statecraft by years. Topics such as democracy, autocracy, technocracy, cooperation, competition, segregation, extreme or flat hierarchies and more can be explored without moral boundaries from the outside world; not to mention the examination of applying chemical, physical ou psychological stimuli to these communities.\n\nWe can finally have systematic testing to things we could only look back to observe."
    pw_wonder.301.a: "Start recruiting volunteers."
    pw_wonder.301.b: "Rally the subjects."

It is finally complete.\nUtilizing hundreds of thousands of sensor, cameras and actuators our researcher drones can elaborate many different societal experiments at a city scale. This alone can advance our understanding of evolutionary behavior and deviancy by years.\nTo populate the enclosed city we will need to sever a subset of drones from the gestalt, or occupy it with completely deviant ones, depending on our experimentation needs. Of course, they must be oblivious to the world outside of the dome and any escape attempts should be prevented.\nWith these unknowing drones, elusive topics such as democracy, autocracy, technocracy, cooperation, competition, segregation, extreme or flat hierarchies and more can be explored to better organize and understand foreign empires; not to mention the examination of applying chemical, physical ou psychological stimuli to these communities.\n\nWe can finally have systematic testing of exotic organization patters."
    pw_wonder.302.a: "The sacrifice of deviancy is needed for progress."
    pw_wonder.302.b: "A necessary observation of how other empires face their existence."

    pw_wonder.401.desc: "After many months of work we have established a convenient pit in the surface of [ROOT.GetName] and already our testing site there can be inaugurated along side its sister site, a small orbital station that remains constantly in the zenith of the crater.\nThis area is reserved for extreme conditions engineering testing such as orbital missile propulsion, high gravity spacecraft launches and material resistance to explosion and piercing damage. The orbital sister site presents many new opportunities to test spatial to ground and ground to space targeting.\nWe can also take advantage of the massive height difference to experiment with a variety of building patterns that range from micro to macro gravity and pressure conditions.\n\nCertainly our offensive and defensive capabilities will benefit greatly from bombarding an abyss, if only we can spare extra alloys for the many tests."
    pw_wonder.401.a: "The galaxy is dark and full of enemies, we should be prepared even if we wont use it."
    pw_wonder.401.b: "It will be good to know the extend of the damage we can cause."
