Chronological analysis shows that it seems that $ag_kae_kaut$ modified the ring world in the $ag_kae_kaut$ Cluster some time after the Ancient Civilization no longer active in this galaxy, but many original structures are retained on the ring world after their modification. \n\nOur [Root.GetScienceTeam] found a series of strange ancient weapons in the ring world. Further analysis showed that they were the culprits of the energy activities that destroyed $ag_kae_kaut$ and all intelligent lives in the $ag_kae_kaut$ Cluster. $ag_kae_kaut$ seems to have been gave up the maintenance of these weapons long time ago, and the ancient instructions issued to the $ag_kae_kaut$ Cluster activated these weapons. Unfortunately, those instructions contained a series of misoperations, which caused these ancient weapons to be completely damaged after that activation. Considering that $ag_kae_kaut$ originally knew about the existence of these ancient weapons, although they did not organize a large-scale evacuation because the weapons were accidentally activated, our [Root.GetIntelligenceDepartment] still suspects that $ag_kae_kaut$ was not completely destroyed by ancient weapons.\n\nIn addition, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] also discovered some strange ship design data during the investigation of the ring world. These data indicate that $ag_kae_kaut$ had planned to modify the gravitational weapons of the Ancient Civilization to adapt to their ship designs. These designs have a very high degree of completion. Although the design work stopped near the time when $ag_kae_kaut$ gave up the maintenance of the ancient weapons in the ring world, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] still got a lot of valuable content, including a ship named §HAnnihilator§! by $ag_kae_kaut$, since we have mastered the ship design and construction technology of $ag_kae_kaut$ to a certain extent, we can try to complete the work that $ag_kae_kaut$ has not completed before, but this The ship’s design includes ancient structures that we cannot build on our own, so we may have to use the construction facilities of $ag_kae_kaut$ or the Ancient Civilization to complete the construction of this ship."
