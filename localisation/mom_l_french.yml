Yet as our eyes lay on the endless sea of the void with worlds just waiting to be claimed, we were betrayed. With our military unprepared for such an event, we could only watch as our colonies declared themselves independent, shattering our plans. We have been in a state of cold war with them ever since.

 START_SCREEN_MOM_SEVERANCE:0 "Our civilization prospered on [GetHomeWorldName] for a long time, but our people always felt that our destiny lay out there in the void. Early space exploration limited to our home system by primitive STL-drives yielded an extraordinary discovery. A wormhole connected our system to another further away than we could ever hope to reach by conventional means. Scouts where sent, followed by a colony ship heading for a planet now known as [event_target:mom_severance_colony.GetName]. It was a dream come true, though as any dream it didn't last.\n\nThe wormhole became unstable shortly after our colony's founding. Experts still debate whether it was ever stable to begin with, or whether we'd just been lucky. Many lives were lost when another wave of colonists failed to reach the other side and further manned travel through it was deemed too dangerous. However, communication is still possible, but supplies sent through it have only a 30% expectancy to reach their destination. This separation left us in a precarious situation.\n\nBut now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished the development of the first hyperdrives. We are finally able to reach other stars and hopefully our colony as well."

A discovery has been made in a desolate and sparsely populated area under our dominion - a strange vessel which must have crashed there eons ago. Scientists believe it to be of alien origin and posit that it was once capable of interstellar travel. Thanks to the remote location of this finding, we were able to keep it a secret not only from the broad public but also from our rivals.\n\nToday we will reap the fruits of years of development and research and clandestine operations to establish outposts in our solar system.

In the ancient times our ancestors could not have imagined that one day [GetHomeWorldName] would cease to satiate the [root.GetSpeciesAdj] hunger for resources and even space to live.\n\nDuring the past decades the problems became ever more obvious to all [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Cities turned into monstrous travesties of their former self in a failing effort to accommodate the ever increasing number of citizens. With our research focused on finding ways of coping with this situation there appear to be fewer and fewer solutions to be found on [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nEven the supplies provided by various outposts established throughout the solar system won't stall the inevitable collapse for long.

They claim that they might be able to locate another terminus and ask for the approval to go ahead. If we do then we must act quickly otherwise the shifting gravitic forces will remove the terminus before it can be stabilized."
