All across [From.GetName], vast legions of §Hrobotic soldiers and vehicles§! wage endless war on each other -- on foot, in the air, and beneath the seas, and the crew of the [Root.GetName] witnessed at least one nuclear detonation from orbit during their study. Automated factories replenish lost units with remarkable efficiency, are destroyed by enemy attacks, and are themselves rebuilt by other friendly units. It seems that, even in death, there is no peace on [From.GetName].\n\n[Root.Leader.GetName] suggests that a permanent colony in one of the quieter regions might allow us to study the situation further, but warns that doing so could put the lives of our [Root.Owner.GetResearchers] at risk of being caught in the crossfire."

mzilli_anomaly_events.xx.intro:0 "Our colony on §H[Root.GetName]§! was attacked this morning by a flight of automated bombers, belonging to one of the robotic factions waging war on the [Root.GetPlanetHabitat].

mzilli_anomaly_events.xx.attacked:0 "mzilli_anomaly_events.96.intro\n\nThe robots apparently mistook our surveyors for enemy scouts and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties before withdrawing.

mzilli_anomaly_events.xx.name:0 "Our analysis of the robotic war on §Y[From.GetName]§! has turned up some interesting leads.\n\nThere are three main robotic factions on the planet, which have been designated Alpha, Beta, and Gamma by our [Root.GetResearchers]. The robots (along with the AI supercomputers guiding them) were created by three superpowers that inhabited the [From.GetPlanetHabitat] four centuries ago to augment their respective militaries. These superpowers eventually entered into a state of war and were destroyed in the ensuing nuclear cataclysm, leaving the robots behind to continue fighting in their stead.\n\nThe [Root.GetResearchers] do not believe that any of the central AIs are sapient, nor necessarily genocidal. They are continuing their creators' war for no other reason than the fact that no one has arrived to shut them down yet."

mzilli_anomaly_events.xx.name:0 "§Y[FromFrom.GetName]§!: Programmed Patterns"
mzilli_anomaly_events.xx.desc:0 "The behaviors of the three robotic factions on §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! are similar in most respects, being devoted to destroying the industrial capabilities of the others while defending their own, but some distinct tactics have been observed.\n\nThe §BAlpha§! faction is the most aggressive of the three, and demonstrates a willingness to destroy resources and infrastructure to deny it to the enemy in the event the Alphas cannot secure them for themselves. This behavior is inherently unsustainable, and it remains to be seen how much longer the Alphas can survive using these tactics.\n\nThe §MBeta§! faction is less aggressive than the Alphas, and seems to be trying to limit collateral damage, not just to the infrastructure but to the [FromFrom.GetPlanetHabitat] itself and its biosphere. This behavior may be inherited from the attitudes of the culture that created them four hundred years ago, but it is impossible to say for sure at this point.\n\nThe §HGammas§! are the smallest of the three factions, but also the one that demonstrates the most adaptive and versatile tactics. In one skirmish, the Gammas withdrew from a contested valley and allowed the Alphas and Betas to move in and fight over it; when they had worn themselves down to spare parts, the Gammas moved back in and secured the valley with no casualties whatsoever. These tactics have allowed the Gammas to survive and even thrive in spite of their smaller resource base."

mzilli_anomaly_events.xx.name:0 "At long last, our [Root.GetResearchers] on §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§! have identified the locations of the three supercomputers directing the robotic war on the [FromFromFrom.GetPlanetHabitat]. They are confident that shutting these primitives AIs down will bring an end to the war, allowing up to expand across [FromFromFrom.GetName] with impunity.\n\nUnfortunately, all three are located in heavily-shielded bunkers several kilometers beneath the surface. Attempting to destroy them with conventional weapons would likely cause significant collatoral damage, possibly rendering large swaths of the [FromFromFrom.GetPlanetHabitat] uninhabitable in the near term. All three bombardments would have to take place simultaneously, in order to prevent any one robotic faction from expanding out of control without being kept in check by their enemies.\n\nOur [Root.GetResearchers] have proposed an alternative: using a $science_ship$, we can remotely interface with the three AIs and feed them huge quantities of junk data that will overload their systems and shut them down -- in effect, a massive Denial-of-Service attack. In theory, this method will leave no collateral damage, but as these supercomputers are not well understood we cannot know for sure what the consequences will be."
