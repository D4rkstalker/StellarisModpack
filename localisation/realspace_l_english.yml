  pc_magnetar_desc:0 "Magnetars are neutron stars with an extremely strong magnetic field and an extremely high density. They may have a higher gravitation than a some black holes. Magnetars are capable of emitting such strong flashes of gamma and X-ray radiation, that they can damage electronic equipment located billions of kilometers from the star. The average life span of a magnetar is about 1 million years. Because of the strong magnetic field, movement around the magnetar is difficult, and the radiation emitted, disrupts the operation of reflectors, rendering the shields of ships and stations useless."

Now all updates §BReal Space§! and other mods will be released first on §WPatreon§! and only after publishing on Steam. This decision was not easy for me, but I ask you to treat this with understanding. Working on mods is very time-consuming, and I was faced with the choice of abandoning mod support or switching to Patreon. Now, subscribers to my Patreon page can receive updates two weeks earlier. Follow the news there with the development of new mods.\n\nIn patch 3.5 there are not too many changes, but they are very useful. Fixed a bug when the rings of the planets were not removed during the construction of the ring world. Added the ability to forcibly reduce the number of inhabited planets at the beginning of the game. Shaders are built in for compatibility with Event Horizon Offset Facility Mod.\n\nReport any bugs and suggestions on Steam, Twitter, Discord or Vkontakte. Enjoy your game!"
