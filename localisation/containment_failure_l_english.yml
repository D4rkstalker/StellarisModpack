 origin_containment_failure:0 "Containment Failure"
 origin_containment_failure_desc:0 "This civilisation has been locked on its homeworld for millennia by eight moons emitting a strange and powerful energy field preventing their escape. Only recently have they had a chance to start expanding again when one of the 8 molten moons mysteriously cooled down.."

 # Origin Start Screen
 START_SCREEN_CONTAINMENT:0 "It has been several hundred thousand cycles since your empire was locked into your homeworld. Eight moons each emitting a powerful energy field have stood watch over your homeworld. So powerful these fields they have kept you from reaching into space. Powerful electromagnetic storms also ravage and race across the planet all to keep your empire in check and contained to this one world. What you know of your captors, your jailers, is unknown. Your entire species memory banks had been wiped clean. \n\nNow, for unknown reasons, one of the moons that has locked you in has rapidly cooled down, turning it into nothing but a lifeless barren world. Its powerful energy field has entirely disappeared providing a narrow path out into the wider galaxy. A wider galaxy, once again for the taking. \n\nWhile the enemies who contained you likely are long gone, there appears to be no sign of any other civilisations around you, space seems dead silent, your expansion can begin once again."

 d_containment_failure_electro_storm_desc:0 "A vast continental sized electromagnetic storm rages across the planet disabling any electronics near it."
 
 # Origin Digsite
 containment_failure_dig:0 "A Thermal Answer"
 containment_failure_dig_intro:0 "We must find out why one of the eight moons had cooled down so we may learn how to prevent it from ever activating the energy field that has locked us in again. Vast amount of resources are set aside for this inquiry. It is vital that we investigate, analyse and document everything."
  
 containment_failure_digsite.1.name:0 "Surface Analysis"
 containment_failure_digsite.1.desc:0 "Large numbers of probes and drones are sent to map out the entire surface of moon §H[from.planet.GetName]§! Their primary purpose is to find any sign of artificial structures and detect any energy that is not natural. The answers we seek must be found somewhere on the moon."
 
 containment_failure_digsite.2.name:0 "Deep Core Drilling"
 containment_failure_digsite.2.desc:0 "None of our scans or readings on the surface of §H[from.planet.GetName]§! have yielded any results. The entire surface is nothing more than solidified molten rock. We must find our answers deeper in the moon’s core. Several large machines have been constructed and will be launched at high velocities towards the moon. Their initial impact will create vast craters and save many cycles as they then start drilling towards the core."
 
 containment_failure_digsite.3.name:0 "The Machine Core"
 containment_failure_digsite.3.desc:0 "Where we expected a molten or solidified core of iron, we found machine. More accurately, we found a single machine that is at the centre of §H[from.planet.GetName]§!. Its structure made of unknown materials, yet it is unmistakable a machine. Every part of the core is designed with purpose, tiny circuits and uncountable amounts of parts are all hooked into each other. Though the machine core appears to lie dormant, we are detecting faint amounts of energy signals. Far from enough to power such a machine, but enough to wonder if the moon truly has finished containing our empire."
 
 # Origin Containment First Event
 
 containment_failure.10.name:0 "Reason [event_target:containment_failure_moon_alpha_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.10.desc:0 "There has to be a reason why moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_alpha_target.GetName]§! cooled down so suddenly. We must find out why lest we end up being contained to this one world again should it reactivate."
 containment_failure.10.a:0 "Perform a full planetary analysis"
 
 containment_failure.11.name:0 "Unexpected [event_target:containment_failure_moon_beta_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.11.desc:0 "Planetary and orbital sensors have all confirmed a secondary moon has cooled down rapidly. Why this is happening remains a complete mystery. Resources have been allocated to construct an orbital network of scanners and survey satellites to investigate the eight moons. Fortunately, with the cooling down of §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_beta_target.GetName]§! a storm on our homeworld has dissipated and has boosted our efficiency."
 
 containment_failure.12.name:0 "Pattern [event_target:containment_failure_moon_omega_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.12.desc:0 "Three is a pattern. Our homeworld's planetary sensors and survey satellites have picked up large and irregular spikes in the energy field emitted from the moon Omega right before it rapidly cooled down. Exactly like moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_alpha_target.GetName]§! and §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_beta_target.GetName]§!, moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_omega_target.GetName]§! has a machine core. Scanning the other moons that are still emitting the energy field is difficult, but pattern recognition suggest they are all the same. Artificially crafted structures designed to emit a powerful energy field to disrupt all electronic functions around our homeworld."
 
 containment_failure.13.name:0 "Expected [event_target:containment_failure_moon_theta_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.13.desc:0 "Moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_theta_target.GetName]§! has cool down, expected but faster than calculated. The pattern suggests the time between the moons cooling down is reduced by exactly 49.776 %-1.223 % every time. Initial calculations indicate the next moon, moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_iota_target.GetName]§! will cool down in 1.32 years."
 
 containment_failure.14.name:0 "On time [event_target:containment_failure_moon_iota_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.14.desc:0 "§H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_iota_target.GetName]§! has cooled down as expected, and with it another energy field has dropped. We are starting to vastly outperform the effects of the energy fields. The electromagnetic storms on our homeworld are also rapidly dissipating. Once all moons have cooled down our capacity to expand will be unchecked and exponential. Our calculations put the next cooldown event on moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_sigma_target.GetName]§! at approximately 8 months."
 
 containment_failure.15.name:0 "Link [event_target:containment_failure_moon_sigma_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.15.desc:0 "The event of §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_sigma_target.GetName]s§! cooling down was expected but not unremarkable. It cooled down exactly as predicted and the machine core remains just as silent as the other moons, except for one variable. A short subspace message has started to bounce between all previous cooled down moons. It is proving extremely difficult to read this subspace message. We are trying. Further calculations indicate moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_zeta_target.GetName]§! to be next in line to cool down in 4 months"
 
 containment_failure.16.name:0 "Message [event_target:containment_failure_moon_zeta_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.16.desc:0 "With the solidifying of moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_zeta_target.GetName]§! the subspace message bouncing between the moons has increased in energy by a factor 8. Decryption and understanding the message is become exceptionally difficult but our sensors are starting to adapt. We have only managed to decipher the last 2 blocks of the message so far:\n\n§Rcontainment..failure..\n\nenergy..cycle..value..overflow..§!\n\nThe last molten moon, moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_gamma_target.GetName]§! is expected to solidify and cool in just 2 months."
 
 containment_failure.17.name:0 "Silent [event_target:containment_failure_moon_gamma_target.GetName]"
 containment_failure.17.desc:0 "Moon §H[event_target:containment_failure_moon_gamma_target.GetName]§!, the last of the molten moons has cooled down, and with it the subspace message has suddenly stopped entirely as well. Our deciphering of the rest of the bouncing subspace message was a failure. Our sensors are no longer detecting any latent energy readings in any of the moon’s machine cores. We are finally free and our systems are functioning at full efficiency.."
