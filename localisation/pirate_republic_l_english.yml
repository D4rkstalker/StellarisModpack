  pirate_republic.10.name: "Pirates Disappeared"
  pirate_republic.10.desc: "For years, the §Y[pirate_system.GetName]§! system has been plagued with pirates. Not anymore... We just don't now why! Suddenly, all pirate ships left the system at the same time, passing right under our radars. We still have no idea why they left and, mostly important, where they could have gone."
  pirate_republic.10.option: "Keep a lookout for them!"
  pirate_republic.11.name: "Pirates... Found"
  pirate_republic.11.desc: "Good news, bad news. The good news is that the mystery over the sudden disappearence of the pirates installed on the §Y[pirate_system.GetName]§! system has been resolved. The bad news is that they reappeared on the surface of the planet §Y[Root.GetName]§!! It seems it was all part of a planned invasion to take control of the colony!"
  pirate_republic.11.option: "Scurvy bastards!"
  pirate_republic.12.name: "Pirates Repelled"
  pirate_republic.12.desc: "The ground defense forces of §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! was able to overcome the pirate invasion. Unfortunately, the enemies were too ferocious and unruly to keep restrained, so there are no survivors left for us to question. We may never know what were the true intentions of these bandits, but we've learned an important lesson: never leave a pirate out of sight."
  pirate_republic.12.option: "Aye aye, sir."
  pirate_republic.13.name: "Pirates Won"
  pirate_republic.13.desc: "The ground defense forces of §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! fought valiantly to the bitter end, but it was not enough. A life dedicated to violence made the pirates a force to be reckoned with. Now that they are in possession of the planet, its total pillaging is to be expected..."
  pirate_republic.13.option: "Send a relief army immediatelly!"
  pirate_republic.14.name: "The Pirate Republick"
  pirate_republic.14.desc: "It seems that the pirates were not planning a simple sack. Instead of taking any movable goods and leaving, they decided to make §Y[pirate_republic_planet.GetName]§! their new base of operations. Not only that, but their leader apparently proclamed the institution of a new "republick" and is even requesting an audience with [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]!"
  pirate_republic.14.option: "The sheer audacity of it all!"
  pirate_republic.100.name: "[pirate_republic.GetName]"
  pirate_republic.100.desc: "Why, hello there!\n\nYou must be the former owners of §Y[pirate_republic_planet.GetName]§!. It's a pleasure to finally be acquainted with you.\n\nBefore we come to the usual threats, I would like to make you an offer. Unless you want to shout uselessly at me first? It's been a long day, I completely understand. Go on ahead."
  pirate_republic.100.a: "Return this planet right now!"
  pirate_republic.100.a.response: "Sorry, not gonna happen. Me and my men took a fondness to it. Such a lovely place!"
  pirate_republic.100.b: "You really think you can keep this system?"
  pirate_republic.100.b.response: "Absolutely not! I'm well aware of how might and strong your armies are and yadda yadda. Which is why I want you to listen to my offer. What you have to loose? If you don't like it, you can just take this system back anyway."
  pirate_republic.100.c: "What are you aiming at?"
  pirate_republic.100.c.response: "To stop being a pirate, of course! You have any idea of how dangerous is this line of work? Me and my men just want a comfortable retirement, away from the hazardous life in outer space. I'm sure you can understand that."
  pirate_republic.100.d: "Humour me. Let's hear this "offer" of yours."
  pirate_republic.101.desc: "Let's be honest here: if §Y[pirate_republic_planet.GetName]§! was important to you, there would be no way in hell we could have invaded it. So why waste your time with such an unimportant planet?\n\nHere's an idea: let us govern this system for you. We'll give you a cut of everything we get, and you can just focus your attention on more important matters.\n\nSo, what do you think?"
  pirate_republic.101.insane: "Are you insane?"
  pirate_republic.101.refuse: "Out of question. End communications."
  pirate_republic.102.desc: "I can assure you I'm not. It's just a simple fact. You have too much on your hands. Why care about little, insignificant [pirate_republic_planet.GetName]? Let us handle it for you. You'll get all the benefits and none of the worries. What is not to like?\n\nOr you can just take it back with your armies. I know it would be easy to you. But is it worth your time?"
  pirate_republic.102.accept: "Maybe I'M insane, after all. Ok, we accept your offer."
  pirate_republic.102.refuse: "You ARE insane. End communications."
  pirate_republic.103.desc: "Ah, such a pity. This planet is just so pretty. A bunch of cornered and unruly pirates loose- wait, you accepetded? I... I actually didn't think it would work. Oh, well. No turning back, now!"
  pirate_republic.103.option: "I'm already regretting it..."
  pirate_republic.104.desc: "Ah, such a pity. This planet is just so pretty. A bunch of cornered and unruly pirates loose on its surface fighting for their life can't be good for it."
  pirate_republic.104.option: "Bloddy pirates!"
