 antimatter_star_anom_cat:0 "Violent Star"
 antimatter_star_anom_desc:0 "This star seems completely ordinary from afar, but upon close inspection it is apparent that it reacts violently to any kind of matter that approaches it."
 antimatter_star_planet_cat:0 "Broken planet"
 antimatter_star_planet_desc:0 "This planet is almost completeley destroyed into several chunks, as if something quite violent happened to it."

 hypostars.1.name:0 "Antimatter Star"
 hypostars.1.desc:0 "Despite the violent reactions of [From.GetName] to any external matter, the [Root.GetName] manages to investigate in depth this curious star. The investigations carried out by the [Root.GetName] establish [From.GetName] to be a star made entirely of antimatter, the counterpart with opposite electric charge to the regular matter that makes up the rest of the Universe. It is probable that it formed inside an Antimatter Galaxy, and by random chance was expulsed from there and ended up in our Galaxy. The violent response of [From.GetName] to external matter comes from the fact that if any antimatter and its matter counterpart come close enough, they annihilate and produce radiation in a sizable explosion. The crew of the [Root.GetName] suggest further investigation into the matter to ascertain if it could have practical uses."
 hypostars.2.name:0 "Broken planet"
 hypostars.2.desc:0 "With cautious examination, the crew of the [Root.GetName], under the guidance of Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], determine that [From.GetName] suffered the violent ejections of antimatter coming from its parent star. It was likely captured by [From.From.GetName], and after eons of these bombardings, the planet came appart into pieces, and will continue to dissolve in the future, probably ending up as an asteroid belt around the star."
 
 hypostars_antimatter_project:0 "Further investigation about the Antimatter Star"
 hypostars_antimatter_project_DESC:0 "Our scientists hope that a more exhaustive investigation of the newly found Antimatter Star could produce some practical applications and shed some light into the composition of our Universe."
 
 hypostars.401.name:0 "Our understanding of the Universe grows"
 hypostars.401.desc:0 "The lengthy investigations of our scientists on the Antimatter Star have led to a significant increase of our knowledge of antimatter and its properties, leading us closer to being able to use it for practical millitary and scientific purposes."
 
 # Anomaly failures
 
 hypostars.201.name:0 "Fateful flare"
 hypostars.203.name:0 "Hull breach"
 hypostars.202.name:0 "Total destruction"
 
 hypostars.201.desc:0 "An unexpected solar flare caught the [Root.GetName] by surprise, damaging the main thrusters of the ship and leaving it inoperative. Luckily the crew could escape unscathed."
 hypostars.203.desc:0 "The debris field of the broken planet made the navigation of the [Root.GetName] very difficult due to the vast amount of rocks in a relatively small space. It also interfered with the ship's scanners, so the research was abandoned before completion."
 hypostars.202.desc:0 "A small asteroid was on a collision course with the antimatter star when the [Root.GetName] was conducting its investigations. This provoked a particularly strong explosion in the chromosphere of the star, that sent a powerful coronal mass ejection of antimatter into the [Root.GetName], destroying it and its crew in the process."
