 # House Divided Localisation
 origin_mom_house_divided:0 "Ein Geteiltes Zuhause"
 origin_mom_house_divided_desc:0 "Schon während den ersten galaktischen Schritten durchlitt diese Zivilisation eine schwere Krise. Nach der Etablierung der ersten zwei Kolonien und ihre Aufmerksamkeit nun auf die verbleibende Weite des Weltraums gerichtet sahen sie den Verrat nicht kommen. Die Kolonien, mit der sich im Heimatsystem befindenden Regierung unzufrieden, rebellierten und zogen ihre gesamte Spezies mit ins Chaos."
 origin_tooltip_mom_house_divided_effects:0 "Zwei weitere Reiche dieser Spezies befinden sich in benachbarten Systemen."
 origin_mom_house_divided_splinter_colony:0 "Splitter Kolonie"
 origin_mom_house_divided_splinter_colony_desc:0 "This society started out as colonists under their mother nation. Whether it was perceived oppression, political opportunism or simply a strong will to forge its own destiny, this former colony renounced its homeworld's administration and declared independence."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_HOUSE_DIVIDED:0 "Since the earliest times, our people reached for ever greater goals. We fought wild beasts, tamed the lands, built great cities and spread across our world.\nEventually with the invention of hyperdrive technology we went on to reach for the stars. During our early expansion, small colonies grew to become new homes for our people and a foundation for what was to come. Yet as our eyes lay on the endless sea of the void with worlds just waiting to be claimed, we were betrayed. With our military unprepared for such an event, we could only watch as our colonies declared themselves independent, shattering our plans. We have been in a state of cold war with them ever since. But this madness will end now.\n\nA house divided cannot stand. Unity must be achieved, be it by diplomacy or military force. We will not be denied our destiny!"

 # Severance Localisation
 origin_mom_severance:0 "Die Teilung"
 origin_mom_severance_desc:0 "Noch bevor sie die erste Hyperraumverbindung erkundete, fand diese Zivilisation ein Wurmloch in ihrem Heimatsystem. Von Neugier getrieben sprangen bald die ersten Erkunder hindurch und auf der anderen Seite wurde ein Außenposten errichtet um künftiges Hindurchspringen zu erleichtern. Leider destabilisierte sich das Wurmloch schon nach einiger Zeit und das durchqueren wurde zu gefährlich. Verbindung zwischen Heimat und Außenposten wurde getrennt."
 origin_tooltip_mom_severance_effects:0 "Beginnt mit einem Wurmloch in eurem Heimatsystem und einer Kolonie auf der anderen Seite. Die erforderliche Technologie um dieses zu bereisen ist noch nicht vorhanden."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_SEVERANCE:0 "Our civilization prospered on [GetHomeWorldName] for a long time, but our people always felt that our destiny lay out there in the void. Early space exploration limited to our home system by primitive STL-drives yielded an extraordinary discovery. A wormhole connected our system to another further away than we could ever hope to reach by conventional means. Scouts where sent, followed by a colony ship heading for a planet now known as [event_target:mom_severance_colony.GetName]. It was a dream come true, though as any dream it didn't last.\n\nThe wormhole became unstable shortly after our colony's founding. Experts still debate whether it was ever stable to begin with, or whether we'd just been lucky. Many lives were lost when another wave of colonists failed to reach the other side and further manned travel through it was deemed too dangerous. However, communication is still possible, but supplies sent through it have only a 30% expectancy to reach their destination. This separation left us in a precarious situation.\n\nBut now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished the development of the first hyperdrives. We are finally able to reach other stars and hopefully our colony as well."
 
 # Breakaway Civilization Localisation

 origin_mom_breakaway_civ_desc:0 "Still fractured into various nation states, this civilization made its first steps on the way to become spacefaring after the discovery of an ancient alien wreckage. Unbeknownst by its rivals or even its own population, one of the worlds superpowers began reverse engineering the alien technology in secrecy."
 origin_tooltip_mom_breakaway_civ_effects:0 "Begin with fewer pops but the potential of planetary unification, which if achieved provides access to the workforce and natural resources of the other nation states.\nBeware the looming threat of nuclear war and try to ease the tensions...\nOr face the consequences of your mistakes..."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_BREAKAWAY_CIV:0 "[GetHomeWorldName] is a fractured world, divided between various superpowers. Wars dominated our history, but the splitting of the atom and its derived weapons of mass destruction changed everything.\n\nThough major conflicts have ceased under the threat of mutually assured destruction, we are living in a state of cold war and tensions are higher than ever before.\n\nBut even in these trying times, we have been blessed with good fortune. A discovery has been made in a desolate and sparsely populated area under our dominion - a strange vessel which must have crashed there eons ago. Scientists believe it to be of alien origin and posit that it was once capable of interstellar travel. Thanks to the remote location of this finding, we were able to keep it a secret not only from the broad public but also from our rivals.\n\nToday we will reap the fruits of years of development and research and clandestine operations to establish outposts in our solar system. The [GetName] might not know it yet, but future history books will speak of this day as the beginning of a new age, as we send out our first explorational vessel to another star."

 START_SCREEN_MOM_GOD_EMPEROR:0 "In the distant past, our people fought amongst themselves in a never-ending cycle of violence and retribution. We would still be caught in this madness today, had it not been for [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName].\n\nWhen [ruler.GetSheHe] first revealed [ruler.GetHerselfHimself] to our ancestors, they were nothing more than savages. Yet [ruler.GetHerHis] charisma made them loyal followers of [ruler.GetHerHis] cause. Within a few decades, all [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] had been united behind the [Root.GetRulerTitle], entering a new age of prosperity and progress under [ruler.GetHerHis] benevolent rule.\n\nToday, on the 2200th anniversary of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]'s coronation, our civilization will also enter a new age of exploration as our first hyperspace-capable prototype starts its journey to discover distant worlds."

 START_SCREEN_MOM_EXILES:0 "Since ancient times our legends tell the story of a doomed world - ravaged by a merciless foe - and our ancestors, who narrowly escaped their brethren's fate. A long flight from their homeworld in a ragtag fleet of freighters eventually led them to [GetHomeWorldName]. Ill equipped with what little they had left, a colony was founded. Much knowledge and technology was lost in the struggle and hardship of making this planet their new home.\n\nNow, over two millennia later, our civilization has recovered. Great cities have been built, the wilderness tamed, and we are finally ready to return to the stars."
