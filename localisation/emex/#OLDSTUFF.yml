 #begin.1.desc:0 "We are the true descendants of the noble Gatebuilders, the great ones that created the gateway network, as well as the §YL-Gates§!, leading to the mysterious §YL-Cluster§!. Their influence across the galaxy was great, and their knowledge, second to none. \n\nBut it was not to last for long. \n\nAs their descendants, it is up to us to reclaim the legacy of the Gatebuilders, once more show our superiority over the rest of the galaxy."

 #qfts.0.name:0 "Our Quest for the Seeders"
 # qfts.0.desc:0 "Long ago, we were all seperated. We were different from one another, working as millions on their own, with horrible inefficiency. \n\nThen, from the heavens, came our saviors. They allowed us to be united, all as one, yet, still many. \n\nSadly, they left us. But before we were abandoned, we managed to acquire some texts from them. Now, it is our duty and goal to once again reunite with our 'ancestors'. We do not know where they are. We do not know if they are still here. We do not know if they are friendly. \n\nBut that won't stop us.  "
 #qfts.0.a:0 "And find them, we shall."
 #shiva1_digsite:0 "Pulverized Planet" 
 #shiva1_digsite_desc:0 "This planet is no more. It is completely shattered and in thousands upon thousands of pieces. Yet, the planet is covered in acres of ruins, remnants from a civilisation long gone. \n\nFurthermore, there are signs of battle, and much debris around the planet. What could have done this, and why?" 
 #qfts.1.name:0 "Primitive Society" 
 #qfts.1.desc:0 "The buildings on the planet tell us that this world was once inhabited by a primitive species. It seems that they were in the medieval era at the time of the planet's destruction. \n\nBy what was found on the planet, there was no knowledge that the world was going to be cracked. The population just died, but the corpses had no clear injuries, indicating that they died of a lack of oxygen." 
 #qfts.1.a:0 "But why did this happen?" 
 #qfts.2.name:0 "Planetary Observation" 
 #qfts.2.desc:0 "A crashed space station has been found on the planet, originally thought to have been in orbit as a place to perform experiments. \n\nFurther investigation suggests that it was an observation post, rather. Considering that the species on the world was quite primitive, it must've been built by another, much more advanced species. Logs found in the station show that the crew experimented on the species native to §YTesfin§!, known as the §YFlistonals§!." 
 #qfts.2.a:0 "Interesting." 
 #qfts.3.name:0 "Alien Space Post" 
 #qfts.3.desc:0 "Not that far from the crashed observation post, lay the very-much dead corpses of another alien race; probably the species that observed the Flistonals. \n\nIn the trouser pocket of one of the corpses, a small book was found. Almost all of the pages were filled with text, but the very odd thing is that it was written a language very similar to ours. Many scientists speculate that these were our ancestors, but DNA tests prove this was incorrect. Our archaeologists also found a card, which could reveal the contents of the last unexplored room of the observation post." 
 #qfts.3.a:0 "A mystery for another day." 
 #qfts.4.name:0 "Super-Heated Core" 
 #qfts.4.desc:0 "Our original predictions that a weapon was used to shatter Tesfin were correct. In the room that was opened with the card, were plans. Diagrams of the planet, as well as some of many different ships and weapons filled the room. Papers covered in writing were attached to some pictures, as well as pictures. \n\nOn the desk, there was a computer of sorts. The last used program was a messaging program, with an unread message being sent to the owner last. It reads: 'The enemy are firing their weapon. Don't know what it does, but it's huge. Get to §YNiten§!, now!' \n\nLooks like the receiver never managed to get out." 
 #qfts.4.a:0 "A shame. To Niten, we shall go!" 
 #qfts.4.b:0 "This will lead us nowhere." 
 #shiva2_digsite:0 "Symbiotic Surface" 
 #shiva2_digsite_desc:0 "This planet is covered from top to bottom in some... disease? Disgusting pores and sticky substances cover every building and piece of land. Could this be the reason the planet was abandoned by its former inhabitants? \n\nArchaeologists are eager to investigate, but many are too afraid to actually land on the planet."
 #qfts.5.name:0 "Long Abandoned" 
 #qfts.5.desc:0 "Niten was indeed widely inhabited by the same species that observed the primitives on Tesfin, but you'd never tell. Somehow, the living things on the planet, sapient or not, were killed. Their tissue became extremely deteriorated, but the odd landscape seems to have not become what it is because of the disaster destroying all living things. The world looked like this before that had happened." 
 #qfts.5.a:0 "Why would've someone lived here?" 
 #qfts.6.name:0 "One Mind" 
 #qfts.6.desc:0 "Much evidence points to the fact that the inhabitants of Niten had been a §YHive Mind§!. All people were just drones, under the complete control of the great Mind. The brains of the corpses have something odd: a small, hexagonal mark is on the brain, but seems to have been removed by someone. All corpses found has this mysterious mark. Our scientists believe there was an extra "part" of the brain, which could've been the thing that allowed the Hive to communicate." 
 #qfts.6.a:0 "Keep working on it!" 
 #qfts.7.name:0 "Degraded Environment" 
 #qfts.7.desc:0 "Not only animals and intelligent beings suffered from the disaster which destroyed their biological tissue. Plants and even the simplest forms of bacteria were killed in the disaster, but no further insights have been made about what did this. \n\nCoincidentally, there appears to be an unusually high level of neutrons in the atmosphere..." 
 #qfts.7.a:0 "Another weapon...?" 
 #qfts.8.name:0 "An Escapee's Tale" 
 #qfts.8.desc:0 "In the tallest building on the planet, which our team entered because of its high heat signature, there was a huge computer, with a dead alien of the same species as the other bodies. However, this one does not have the strange mark on its brain, and it seems to have been stabbed by someone. \n\nOn the computer, the very same messaging program that was last used, was on the screen. It reads: 'The council have made the vote. They're going to sweep Niten in three hours; no matter if there are any soldiers here or not. I need you to send a ship. Please hurry. See you at §YVarnoll§!.'" 
 #qfts.8.a:0 "Maybe we'll discover something at Varnoll." 
 #shiva3_digsite:0 "Abandoned Nexus" 
 #shiva3_digsite_desc:0 "On the surface of Varnoll, there is a gargantuan system of buildings, all connected to one another. What appear to be vehicles for military purposes are spread across the planet, with nobody to use them. \n\nCould the world be some sort of ancient military station?" 
 #qfts.10.name:0 "A Military Base" 
 #qfts.10.desc:0 "The system of buildings on the surface seems to be a military base, run by both the species found on both Tesfin and Niten. Only a few bodies have stayed there, all having a hole in the centre of their heads. There is no doubt they have been shot. Yet, these species also do not have any hexagon mark on their brains, which our scientists had to pry open. \n\nThe exact purpose of this military base is still unknown to us, but it has definitely seen some action." 
 #qfts.10.a:0 "Keep investigating." 
 #qfts.11.name:0 "The Hub" 
 #qfts.11.desc:0 "Not only was the military base used for military purposes, but it was also a giant generator, producing tons of energy per hour. After all of these years, the hub is still active, but cannot be deactivated; it requires a five-digit code to access. \n\nOur archaeologists are curious as to what needed this much energy." 
 #qfts.11.a:0 "Then don't dawdle!" 
 #qfts.12.name:0 "An Artifical Mind" 
 #qfts.12.desc:0 "After finding instructions about how to mass-produce the brain implants, that have a hexagonal shape, our archaeologists have concluded that each person with the mark on their brain had one of these implants, which allowed them to join the Hive Mind and be under the control of the Mind, according to the text. The Hive Mind wasn't natural; it was made by some ambitious scientists! \n\nSome of our scientists investigated the implants in more detail. They are all connected to a superior implant, which could not be found." 
 #qfts.12.a:0 "They were a cyborg-hive?" 
 #qfts.13.name:0 "Deviants in the Hive" 
 #qfts.13.desc:0 "According to the logs found in the Main Nexus, the '§YDeviants§!' tried to invade the planet and military base, perhaps to turn off the Hub, thus, destroying the Hive. The bodies previously found could be that of the Deviants, as they did not have any implants, our crew thinks. \n\nHowever, due to the mass loss of bodies on both sides, it is impossible to tell who won. But the fact that the Hub is still on leads many to believe that the Deviants lost." 
 #qfts.13.a:0 "Deviants?" 
 #qfts.14.name:0 "Research Complex" 
 #qfts.14.desc:0 "Our archaeologists believe that they had found the area where research was done on the weapons that pulverized Tesfin. Not only was evidence of that found in the science section, but many other plans which did different things. Some talked about bombarding the moon of Varnoll, some about terraforming §YVarnoll§! itself to suit the species; the list went on. \n\nBut the text that was highlighted mentioned covering the surface of Poldan somehow in some sort of barrier." 
 #qfts.14.a:0 "That explains Poldan's 'situation'." 
 #qfts.15.name:0 "Poldan's Surface" 
 #qfts.15.desc:0 "We found the machine controlling the shield over Poldan. The machine is connected to the satellite dish on top of the tallest building, which is pointed towards Poldan. Our scientists suggest that it is firing a beam, which is invisible to us, towards the atmosphere of Poldan. The beam stops at the atmosphere and spreads across it entirely until the moon is covered by some strange substance. The more the dish fires, the stronger the shield gets. \n\nIt may be possible for the shield to disappear if we turn away the satellite dish..." 
 #qfts.15.a:0 "Lower that shield!" 
 #qfts.15.b:0 "We can't risk releasing what's inside." 
 #qfts.160.name:0 "Lowering Poldan's Shield" 
 #qfts.160.desc:0 "As soon as the dish was turned away from Poldan by our crew remotely, the shield on the moon began to glow extremely brightly. Slowly, the shield began to disintegrate, from top to bottom, revealing the land below. \n\nSuddenly, a large ship came out of the atmosphere! When they got out into space, they began hailing the science ship above Varnoll." 
 #qfts.160.a:0 "On screen." 
 #qfts.16.desc:0 "It's one of the aliens that were found throughout the Shiva system! It is clear that this one is not part of the Hive. \n\n'Hello? Is anyone there? Oh, thank goodness, you freed me! I was stuck on Poldan for hundreds of years now, I think...'" 
 #qfts.16a:0 "Who are you?" 
 #qfts.16a.response:0 "We are, or rather, were, the Shivkonians. We were once united and peaceful, but when a dictator took over the empire, he wanted the people to do exactly what he said, without question. Naturally, the people didn't want to do that, and they began to riot. He and his scientists created a brain implant of sorts, which was implanted into every person they could find. A special one was given to the dictator, which was wirelessly connected to the Alpha Nexus, on Varnoll. They became an artificial Hive Mind." 
 #qfts.16b:0 "What happened to Tesfin?" 
 #qfts.16b.response:0 "Well you see, not everyone was found. A group of rebels led a revolution against the Hive. To escape the military drones, they fled to Tesfin, where they set up base. The Hive was already aggressively observing the primitives on the planet, known to us as the Flistonals. They recruited some primitives and taught them what to do, but the Shivkonian Hive had other plans. \n\nThey used a weapon, what can only be described as a Planet Killer, to obliterate the world. This was a massive setback for the resistance. Luckily for them, some other rebels took control of Poldan already." 
 #qfts.16c:0 "Why is Niten... the way it is?" 
 #qfts.16c.response:0 "It may seem like an infection to your kind, but it was considered a paradise by the Hive Mind. Not only that, it was rendered completely inhabitable for any other species. It was the capital of the Shivkonians. You may not have noticed, but there is little to no life on the planet now. \n\nAlthough it has been a long time, the planet was, in a way, destroyed. The Planet Killer that was used against is was now used against them. We had our own design, but the main difference was that we were humane. We did not want to destroy our old home, so we used the power of neutrons. The entire planet was swept by a wave of neutrons, and any living thing was killed." 
 #qfts.16d:0 "What is the military complex on Varnoll?" 
 #qfts.16d.response:0 "Oh, that's Alpha Nexus. It was the core of the Hive, which kept the brain implants working and connected to the main one. It was later repurposed as a military base to fight the rebellion. Soon, the enemy Planet Killer was getting ready at the base, to destroy Poldan. However, we had an advantage. My people had a remote control, which could deactivate the Hive. As soon as the killer got in orbit, I would flip the switch to destroy the Hive. Well, I wouldn't flip it though; there were too many allies on Varnoll. But they didn't know that. \n\nLittle did we know, the base on Varnoll had another weapon. They covered the entire world in a shield; nothing could get in. \n\nNothing could get out." 
 #qfts.16e:0 "What happened after that?" 
 #qfts.16e.response:0 "I do not know. \n\nBy that point, there were only pockets of rebels on Niten. We had no hope. At the same time, chaos fell upon Poldan. Many died, few survived, but just barely. It is clear that the Shivkonian Hive eventually fell, but how that came to happen, I don't know." 
 #qfts.16f:0 "Are you... the seeders?" 
 #qfts.16f.response:0 "...No, that's not possible... \n\n You, are you the [Species.GetNamePlural]? \n\nYou see, before the implants were used on the population, the dictator allowed his scientists to experiment ways to create an artificial Hive Mind. You were one of the civilisations we experimented on. Obviously, your kind survived, and it worked, but there were no clear immediate effects, so they just thought that it didn't work..." 
 #qfts.16g:0 "So, what now?" 
 #qfts.16g.response:0 "I have already suffered much in my extremely long life. I am not sure if others still live; if I am truly the last Shivkonian, I cannot restore our legacy alone. \n\nI will forever be in your debt for saving me, but there is no point of my existence, especially at such an old age. \n\nGoodbye." 
 #qfts.17.name:0 "The Last Shivkonian" 
 #qfts.17.desc:0 "The Shivkonian that we rescued from Poldan has decided to end his life. It is understandable, however, after how much he had suffered.\n\nWhile we did not achieve what we were planning for on this journey, we have found the truth about the seeders. Despite not gaining anything physically, all drones throughout the Hive feel an emptiness within them, filled."

 #graygoo.420.c:0 "Hello? Carry on."
 #graygoo.420c.response:0 "Once we got stuck in the L-Cluster, we lost all contact with the galaxy, and, sure, we never really knew for sure what happened in the galaxy while we were gone, but, we naturely assumed that, without us, your civilisation would crumble. \n\nAfter all, we had introduced some very §Ystrange§! technologies to your kind, without actually giving your species the ability of space exploration. Surely, that would've caused some serious wars, and will inevitably cause society to crumble. \n\nObviously, that was not the case."
 #graygoo.420.d:0 "Yes. So, we had some-"
 #graygoo.420d.response:0 "Oh, how wonderful!

 #qfts.100.name:0 "Nanite Covered"
 #qfts.100.desc:0 "The entire world is definitely covered in nanites; simple but powerful nanoactuators, allowing for complex manipulations and experiments of macroscopic scales. \n\nNot one inch of land is free of the ocean of gray goo, constantly changing shape. Not much else is found on the surface at all, and our archaeologists feel that spending more time on the planet will yield no results, and apart from many deaths."
 #qfts.100.a:0 "You can't just give up now!"
 #qfts.101.name:0 "Secret Bunker"
 #qfts.101.desc:0 "The archaeology team, after many hours, have found a large underground city, many miles under the surface, seeming abandoned. Despite this, it seems that the nanites on the surface have never reached the city. Only one, tall building remains mainly intact, with the inside being covered in posters and books, all in the exact same language as the texts found in the §YShiva system§!. \n\nCould this underground bunker be the remains of a Shivkonian colony?"

 #qfts.102.name:0 "Research Labs"
 #qfts.102.desc:0 "Upon further inspection of the bunkers underground, a small portion of matching buildings are filled with mysterious liquids, materials and diagrams! Our team have concluded that these were once used as laboratories, where research was conducted, the latest investigation being about these nanobots. \n\nSome diagrams and texts even have extensive descriptions about the nanites, but in another, mysterious language..."
 #qfts.102.a:0 "How odd."
 #qfts.103.name:0 "Dessanu Nanites"
 #qfts.103.desc:0 "After translating several written records of conversations between what appears to be the Shivkonians and another species, it seems that the nanites on the surface were not made by the Shivkonians. \n\nThey were made by the §YDessanu Consonance§!. \n\nNo further insights have been made, but the texts found mention the nanites' place of origin being §YCilonia§!."

 #mahadeva2_digsite:0 "Ancient Nanite Factories"
 #mahadeva2_digsite_desc:0 "After investigating the surface of Cilonia a second time, our archaeologists have discovered a gargantuan factory on the surface, surrounded by hundreds of smaller factories, all connected to the main factory. \n\nCould the nanites on Pesado have come from here?"
 #qfts.104.name:0 "Nanites' Origin"
 #qfts.104.desc:0 "Upon first entering the main factory, our archaeologists have found a sort of notepad, stating the plans to create nanites for some unknown reason.

 #qfts.105.desc:0 "After digging around one of the more minor sections of Ohrimak, our archaeologists have discovered some extensive records regarding the purpose of the nanites that were being produced in the factories. \n\nAnother noteworthy thing was the records that mentioned the reason for the terraforming of the planet. It reads: \n\n'The great process of terraforming the surface of Cilonia will no doubt take a while, but the Shivkonians will no doubt be pleased with us!'"
 #qfts.105.a:0 "So, what happened to the planet?"
 #qfts.106.name:0 "Failure"
 #qfts.106.desc:0 "Nearer to the centre of Ohrimak, some recordings have been found, dating back to around the time of the peak of the Shivkonians, but before the rise of the artificial hive. It shows Pesado, but before it was covered in nanites. It seems to have been quite lush, and full of flora and life. It also seems to have been inhabited, most probably by the Shivkonians. \n\nThen, a giant swarm of nanobots, released from a large cannon-like structure on Cilonia. They completely consume the planet, before they all crash down onto the planet, revealing... \n\nNothing? The world now looks exactly like it does now; covered in nanites."
 #qfts.106.a:0 "A turn of events."
 #qfts.107.name:0 "Revenge"
 #qfts.107.desc:0 "We have found some recorded diplomatic conversations between the Dessanu Consonance and the Shivkonian Star Union. Apparently, the Dessanu Consonance persuaded the Shivkonians to allow them to terraform their first colony, into a §Ygaia class§! world, optimal for all lifeforms. When it failed, the Shivkonians were, understandably, extremely angry. Not only did they lose a colony, but millions died. \n\nThis later made the Shivkonians break any pacts and deals they had with the Dessanu, and the relations between the two empires rapidly deteriorated."
 #qfts.107.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 #qfts.108.name:0 "A New Alliance"
 #qfts.108.desc:0 "Even when the Shivkonians closed their borders to the Consonance, the Dessanu kept control of these factories on the surface of Cilonia. They even used it in the future, and was also repurposed into a research facility. \n\nIt was even in use when the Shivkonian Hive rose. In fact, the Hive contacted this very place, in a bid to ally them to defeat the Deviants. Furthermore, the leader of the resistance, indeed, the same one that we encountered back in the Shiva system, was the President of the Shivkonian Star Union during the time that their relations deteriorated."
 #qfts.108.a:0 "But what was their role?"
 #qfts.109.name:0 "The War"
 #qfts.109.desc:0 "At the very core of Ohrimak, our archaeologists have discovered multiple blueprints, all of which came from the Dessanu Consonance. It seems that they did agree to join the Hive's side in the war, but they did not participate in any actual battles. As far as we know, they only provided the blueprints for these massive weapons, designed for a Colossus. \n\nIronically, the Dessanu's unwillingness to actually fight the Shivkonian Star Union is what led to their very destruction."

 leviathans.69.desc:0 "The seeders? You say they made you into a Hive Mind?

I am surprised that your kind survived, as the experiments were very risky and dangerous. \n\nAnyway, if our records are still correct, we could send the coordinates of their old capital system, for a small price."

 graygoo.69696.a:0 "Just tell us!"
 graygoo.69696a.response:0 "*sigh* \n\nYou see, a long time ago, before the gateways were built, before the L-Cluster was found, we discovered a new technology: simple but powerful nanoactuators, allowing for complex manipulations and experiments of macroscopic scales. We used them for many things in our experiments, such as building, ships, and even terraforming. \n\nIn a time before the §YShivkonian Star Union§! formed the Hive, they asked us if we could terraform a planet of theirs, which did not suit their species after some changes in the environment. We said we could us these experimental nanites, and that, we did, from the nanite factory on its moon."
 graygoo.69696.b:0 "Did it work?"
 graygoo.69696b.response:0 "What you see in the Mahadeva system is what it looked like back then; no, it did not work. We tried hard to persuade the Shivkonians that they were reliable, useful, and assured them that they will definitely work. And when they didn't, the President got angry. \n\nWe worked so hard to assure them otherwise, but in the end, they were right. Millions on the planet died, all because of us. \n\nAfterwards, relations between our empires seriously broke down. They refused to make any contact with us, and all of our diplomatic deals and pacts were suddenly cancelled. It got to a point where another empire had to persuade them not to declare war on us."
 graygoo.69696.c:0 "What happened after that?"
 graygoo.69696c.response:0 "Not much after, the civil war began. The rebels fought the Hive and its new leader, with the old President, the one who broke our friendship, leading the rebellion, or, the Deviants. \n\nHowever, this new Shivkonian Hive recognised our capabilities, and the potential of nanites, and possibly our other inventions. They let us join the war against the Deviants and gave us a share of the spoils, in exchange for giving them some of our more... militant inventions. Yes, one of them was what you would call, the §YColossus§!. \n\nEventually, the rebels were defeated, mainly due to us. The Shivkonian Star Union was no more."
 graygoo.69696.d:0 "The fall of the rebels was your doing."
 graygoo.69696d.response:0 "Yes. We did it. \n\nLooking back on it now, we should not have betrayed our allies. True, they destroyed our relations, but at the end of the day, it was the fault of the Dessanu. We forced them to let us use our nanites on their colony. I am not even sure if we did it to help them out, or to further our research. I now see that. \n\nThank you for helping us realise that."
