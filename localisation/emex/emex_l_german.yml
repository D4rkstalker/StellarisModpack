 qfts.103.a:0 "How peculiar."
 
 qfts.1.name:0 "The Shivkonian Star Union"
 qfts.1.desc:0 "Exploring the minor remains of buildings on the surface of the cracked planet has revealed that they were once the base of an observation mission run by an empire referred to as the §YShivkonian Star Union§!. \n\nAccording to the records, which were quite easily translated, the base was stationed several star systems away from the primitive civilisation which they were studying. \n\nFurthermore, some logs mention "planting special genes into the primitives"."

 qfts.4.name:0 "Trade Hub"
 qfts.4.desc:0 "The station seems to have once been some sort of trade hub, owned by the Shivkonian Star Union.

 qfts.4.a:0 "Interesting."
 qfts.5.name:0 "Station Loans"

 qfts.6.name:0 "The Other Civilisation"
 qfts.6.desc:0 "Some more texts have been found in the last unexplored area of the Raklomia Trade Hub. It appears that the team on the cracked world never paid back the energy credits that they owed, and the writer of the texts seemed considerably frustrated and angry, stating that "that other observation team would never have done this". \n\nOur archaeologists have also found the co-ordinates of a previously uncharted star system."

 qfts.9.a:0 "Where could this colony be?"
 qfts.10.name:0 "Lost Contact"
 qfts.10.desc:0 "It seems that the main Mind on the planet somehow lost contact with the drones on their first colony, possibly due to a malfunction in the engineering of the §YMind Unifier§!, as the Flistonu called it. \n\nIt is not known what happened to the Flistonu colony, but the drones on the capital worked hard to find a way to resolve the situation."

Decades of being extensions of the Mind had scarred the newly free Flistonu, and many had an existential crisis. However, most rioted and chaos filled the world. \n\nEventually, the entire planet was engulfed in conflict, and the result was the extinction of the Flistonu species and the death of the planetary flora and fauna. \n\nOur researchers are interested in finding this colony of theirs, so many have decided to remain on the planet to study whatever they can find.

 qfts.15a.response:0 "I'm sorry? Brothers? \n\nYou say you were "seeded" by a species, which may have been called the Shivkonians? Yes... This sounds familiar. \n\nWe were once like you: a Hive Mind, all united for one purpose, yet, disunited by the lack of freedom. But shortly after colonsing this planet, we lost contact with the main Mind on Flistonia, and all Flistonu were free. \n\nWe never found out what happened to our old homeworld, but we assumed the worst."
 qfts.15.b:0 "What did you do after becoming free?"
 qfts.15b.response:0 "Lucky for us, the colony was still relatively new, so not too many Flistonu caused riots and protests. \n\nIt took everyone awhile to get used to being capable of free thought and the freedom to do things on their own, but the makeshift government at the time assisted those that struggled with this sudden change. \n\nEventually, we started building up our new home, but it was a real struggle without the technology of our old homeworld, as well as the knowledge that was preserved in the Mind."
 qfts.15.c:0 "Tell us about this world."
 qfts.15c.response:0 "New Flistonia was originally a tropical world, filled with flora and fauna. Although our species was more suited to a continental climate, we managed to make do. \n\nAfter decades of research, we discovered how to terraform the planet into a paradise."

Well, it is a dimension of pure pyschic energy, and can be accessed through psionic powers of individuals. \n\nOur species transcended to the Shroud quite recently, but we have managed to receive several boons and benefits from it. \n\nUnfortunately, hive minded individuals cannot enter the Shroud."

Despite their best attempts, the planet was engulfed in chaos, and was doomed to the same fate as their old homeworld. \n\nThe dead Flistonu body we found nearby seems to be the corpse of the leader of the makeshift government.

 qfts.34.name:0 "Grand Complex"
 qfts.34.desc:0 "After searching the cold, barren surface of Nitrel for days, our archaeologists have finally found what they believe to be the generator of the shield surrounding Shivka Prime. \n\nThe massive complex of rooms and buildings tower high over the dry landscape, and the very top of the building is pointing at the shielded world. \n\nHowever, there is no way to enter the complex, at least not from where they are."
 qfts.34.a:0 "Then make an entrance."
 qfts.35.name:0 "Secret Base"
 qfts.35.desc:0 "After successfully detonating explosives near weak points in the complex's walls, the archaeologists have managed to enter the grand building. \n\nIn the first room they entered, several documents written in the Shivkonian language were discovered. Apparently, this complex was a secret base, belonging to the egalitarian faction in the war. The egalitarians knew that the Shivkonian Star Regime had massive fleets, so they decided to ruin their economy and stability, rather than their military. \n\nWhether this meant shielding the homeworld of the Shivkonians or not is unknown."

 qfts.36.name:0 "Generator Room"
 qfts.36.desc:0 "Our archaeologists have managed to reach a room with a massive generator, most likely the generator that is powering the weapon that is creating the shield around Shivka Prime. \n\nFurthermore, a few hastily-written texts were found nearby, mentioning firing the "global pacifier", as they called it, at the planet, with the other base on Varnolk too. This way, it was twice as less likely that the shield will ever come down."
 qfts.36.a:0 "Well, it is still there..."
 qfts.37.name:0 "Destruction of Varnolk"

 qfts.38.name:0 "Unshielding of Shivka Prime"
 qfts.38.desc:0 "With the location of the planetary shield generator on Nitrel found, we can now deactivate the energy shield active on Shivka Prime. \n\nAs our archaeologists saw the crimson lever, they pulled it down with a loud clank. \n\nThe energy shield began to dissipate, and the planet's surface was revealed.

 qfts.40.name:0 "The Colossus Project"
 qfts.40.desc:0 "To fight back against the egalitarian faction in the civil war, the Shivkonian Star Regime decided to prepare a weapon of an unimagineable scale, capable of destroying worlds. This mission was dubbed the Colossus Project, and hundreds of scientists and engineers got to work, devising a massive hull and the great weapon for the ship. \n\nThe phrase "world cracker" is mentioned several times throughout the texts found regarding the project."
 qfts.40.a:0 "Disturbing."
 qfts.41.name:0 "The Neutron Sweep"
 qfts.41.desc:0 "The Colossus ship, armed with a world cracker weapon, was constructed relatively quickly, and its test-fire target was Varnolk, which just so happened to be one of the rebel bases. If the Star Regime knew about the egalitarian base on the moon, they did not mention it in their documents. \n\nThe Shivkonians realised just how wasteful the world cracker is, especially if it was used on one of their former colonies. Instead, the Colossus was later fitted with a "neutron sweep", a weapon that "paints" a planet with neutrons and kills all organic life. \n\nAfter discovering the egalitarians' main source of alloys, the Star Regime decided to utilise the Colossus on an actual target: Krobak, the ancient ecumenopolis we located several star systems away."
 qfts.41.a:0 "Intriguing."
 qfts.42.name:0 "Victory for the Regime"
 qfts.42.desc:0 "Not much is known about what occurred after Krobak was swept of all life. However, it seems that the Shivkonian Star Regime were the victors of the war, and the loyal population threw a massive celebration, and the day came to be known as National Victory Day. \n\nLater on, however, more and more of the population began to grow tired and angry because of the Grand Marshal's rule. The dictator knew of this, and wanted a way to ensure total obedience from all citizens of the regime."
 qfts.42.a:0 "Keep digging."
 qfts.43.name:0 "The Seedings"
 qfts.43.desc:0 "The Grand Marshal's best scientists devised a way to ensure total obedience from the population: by working out a way to connect everyone's minds to the dictator's, he would, effectively, have total control over the lives of everyone, like a Hive Mind. \n\nThe Grand Marshal approved this idea, and two research teams were formed, one of which used a mechanical way to form a Hive Mind, on the Flistonu, and the other used genetic engineering, on our species. \n\nAccording to the dictator's closest advisor, the Grand Marshal was paranoid about the genetic method, as there were rumours saying that the neural link of all those involved would eventually dissipate."
 qfts.43.a:0 "Could this be true?"
 qfts.44.name:0 "The Hive"
 qfts.44.desc:0 "In the end, the Grand Marshal, now the Great Mind, decided to use the mechanical way, possibly due to the rumours about the genetic method, but also because it seems that we did not show signs of forming a gestalt consciousness when we were first seeded. \n\nAfter the mechanical implants were forced into everyone's heads, the research team on our homeworld left, leaving us all alone. \n\nAll that is known is that the Shivkonian Star Regime became the Shivkonian Star Hive. The eventual downfall of the Shivkonians is unknown, as is the loss of the egalitarians."
 qfts.44.a:0 "We may never know the entire truth."
 qfts.45.name:0 "The Shivkonians: The End"
 qfts.45.desc:0 "And thus, our great journey to discover the seeders is at an end. \n\nThe seeders, or the Shivkonians, may no longer be with us now, but their gift to us was unity. They may have not been as united as we are, but we owe our great consciousness to them. \n\nIt is true that many questions have been left unanswered: why did the egalitarian faction fall? What are the nanite beings on New Flistonia and why are they acting as the Flistonu? How did the Shivkonian Star Hive, inevitably, collapse? What happened to the Great Mind of the Hive? We may never know the truth. \n\nHowever, we did manage to retrieve the master neural implant, used by the Great Mind. Why it was left alone is not known, but it is in decent conditon, considering its age, and although we may not be able to utilise its maximum potential, we might be able to gain some insights from the ancient Shivkonians. \n\nMany are confused and afraid of some of the revelations made on Shivka Prime; they fear that our neural link with one another is weakening, and our fate will ultimately be one very similar to that of our ancient brothers, the Flistonu. Researchers are keen on ensuring that we remain united, and are attempting to find new methods to ensure the integrity of our neural link."
 qfts.45.a:0 "Perhaps the reward was the discoveries we made along the way."
 qfts.47.desc:0 "After using up masses of energy, the Shivkonian Mechanical Consciousness has been activated, and we have managed to retrieve an interesting insight from the time of the Shivkonians. \n\nThis particular data fragment is about genetics, and how the Shivkonians utilised their advancements in the field to masterfully genetically engineer their species, as well as seed ours."

A system of machines suggest that the ceiling can be opened and closed at will. \n\nFurthermore, scraps of metal and engineering equipment was found, as well as several half-finished vessels. Presumably, this was some sort of subterranean shipyard, but has since been abandoned, most likely when they received the signal sent by the flagship. \n\nOne vessel in particular stands out, as it is both the only one there which is fully constructed and much larger than the other ships."

Whether the rest of the terrorists would also come is unknown, but the ship was stocked up on fuel and is filled to the brim with resources and documents. \n\nAccording to a piece of paper found, the escape plan was to be carried out around two days before our research team entered the complex of mazes, but was postponed after a group on the planet rioted against the leader, and destroyed some of their research. Soon afterwards, we arrived, so they cancelled the plan altogether, instead escaping in small numbers however they could. \n\nAlthough much of the texts found are either scribbled out, ripped or burnt, a few lines could be made out from the document placed on the captain's desk: "...and soon their empire will be no more... a new empire will... rise from its ashes... A test has just been... on their homeworld... we will see what happens... The Second Coming is nigh..."\n\nWe have also found some sort of machine, which seems to be a partially working §YDNA Engine§! of some sorts.

Properly doing so and preparing for all possible outcomes will take many years. Phase 2 will begin when the order to continue our megastructure at [master_ai_origin.GetName] is given. The time it takes to finish construction completely can be sped up by introducing certain changes, such as §Ydiverting more resources to the project§! or §Yconsulting certain groups that can help§!. \n\nHow much progress we have made towards 100% can be seen by consulting the megastructure that will hold the AI core."
