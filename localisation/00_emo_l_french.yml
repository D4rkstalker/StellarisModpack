emo.3.desc: "If observing the light of distant stars has taught our civilization anything, it is that we are one of a kind. Nine stars are present in close proximity to the black hole our home planet is orbiting. And their combined influence has allowed life as we know it to develop. In the shadow of the supermassive black hole, our ancestors have long since dreamt about taking to the skies. Now, we know that the black hole in our system is not originally from here. A sister galaxy collided with this one over fourteen billion years ago and what is left of its core is now our home.\n\nEven before the development of the first Hyper Drive, scientists had already conceptualized a massive engineering project. It was called: The §YBirch World§!. Using concepts from early theoretical physics, it should be possible to construct a gigantic sphere around the event horizon of the black hole.\nSuch a construction might be far out of our reach for now, but visionaries and nerds agree: It would be the crown jewel of galactic civilization!"

emo.5.title: "Even More Origins: Legacy of Nine Suns"
emo.5.desc: "If observing the light of distant stars has taught our civilization anything, it is that our galaxy is extraordinary. There has been a long-standing theory that the center of each galaxy must be of such concentrated mass that only a black hole or quasar could be present.\nHowever, for as long as that theory exists we have always wondered why it is that our galaxy seemed to have two distinct centers of gravity.\n\nNo longer! With our approach to the second, slightly smaller center, we have learned of its secret: Billions of years ago, a sister galaxy must have collided with our own. But instead of parting ways after the collision, the two merged and both of their cores have now entered a semi-stable orbit that will continue for at least another few billion years.\nThis second core has attracted nine stars which orbit it closer than we have thought possible.\n\nChatter among our scientists includes disturbingly insane proposals for the supermassive black hole. Necessary funding to construct one of these, a so-called §YBirch World§!, would exceed anything already built in the galaxy, be it by us or those who came before."
