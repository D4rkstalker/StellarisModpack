 mac_ring_world_1_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS:1 "A §Y$pc_ringworld_machine$§! allows for multiple planet-like zones, cannibalizing all other planets in the system for materials."
 mac_ring_world_1_CONSTRUCTION_INFO_DELAYED:4 "A full Machine Ring World consists of 4 Completed Machine Ring World Sections, each equivalent to a massive Machine world."
 mac_ring_world_1:0 "Machine Ring World Site"
 mac_ring_world_1_DESC:0 "This complex will serve as a staging ground, resource depot and living quarters for the hundreds of thousands of personnel involved in the Machine Ring World's construction."
 mac_ring_world_2_intermediate:0 "Machine Ring World Frame"
 mac_ring_world_2_intermediate_DESC:0 "This initial skeletal frame encircles the system's sun, and serves as the platform on which we will eventually build fully habitable sections."
 mac_ring_world_2:0 "Machine Ring World Frame Section"
 mac_ring_world_2_DESC:0 "This skeletal frame section makes up roughly one quarter of the unfinished Machine Ring World's total surface area. Work on the smaller habitable section has not yet been completed."
 mac_ring_world_3_intermediate:0 "Completed Machine Ring World Section"
 mac_ring_world_3_intermediate_DESC:0 "A fully functional habitable Machine Ring World section, complete with an active biosphere, that is ready for settlement."
 mac_ring_world_ruined:0 "Ruined Ring Section"
 mac_ring_world_ruined_DESC:0 "This section of the Machine Ring World once supported a functional biosphere, but no longer. Repairs are theoretically feasible, but it would require advanced technology and a large amount of resources."
