 # Righteous Governor
 civwar.1030.righteous.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has long been known as a person of the highest character. Unfortunately, it appears that their high moral fiber combined with disagreements over some of our policies has led them to believe that their sector would be best if governed fully under their authority. As such, they've leveraged their popular support within the sector to declare themselves the leader of an independent nation. It also appears that their popularity extends deep through their sector's military personnel. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

  # Veteran Governor
 civwar.1030.veteran.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§!'s long history of military service to our nation is well known. They've overseen the training of many thousands of cadets, and have been crucial to the strengthening of our armies. Unfortunately, it seems that a part of that training involved instilling a greater loyalty in the cadets towards the governor than towards the state. Leveraging their extensive network of loyal army contacts, Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has taken near complete control of their sector and declared themselves the leader of a new, independent nation. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 # Officer Governor
 civwar.1030.officer.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§!'s career as an admiral in our fleet is well known.

Leveraging their extensive network of loyal fleet contacts, Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has taken near complete control of their sector and declared themselves the leader of a new, independent nation. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 # Slaver Governor
 civwar.1030.slaver.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§!'s efficient use of slave labor was one of the primary factors in their selection as governor. By placing their own personal slaves in key positions throughout their sector, they were able to more effecitvely maximize the output of their sector, which was greatly beneficial to our nation as a whole. Unfortunately, this made it trivial for the governor to signal their slaves to send the taxes and resources of their sector's systems directly to them, which they have just done. They have declared themselves the leader of a new independent nation. With the amount of slaves they have at their disposal, should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 pretender.1.desc_01:0 "[From.GetRegnalName] has passed away, and seven days of mourning have been announced on [Root.Capital.GetName]. Unfortunately, there was no declared heir and two separate claims have been made on the throne.\n\nThe strongest contender has been crowned [Root.GetRulerTitle] under the name [Root.GetRulerName], but this has done little to settle the issue."
 
 pretender.1.desc_02:1 "[From.GetRegnalName] has transcended this realm of existence and begun the journey towards the next. Unfortunately, the Spirits have not yet seen fit to bless us with sufficient signs and portents to conclusively identify a successor.\n\nAfter a heated debate, [Root.GetRulerName] has been crowned as the next [Root.GetRulerTitle] but not without opposition. Pretenders from the senior ranks of the clergy are now attempting to galvanize support."
 
 pretender.1.desc_03:1 "[From.GetRegnalName] has died without a clear heir, leaving our government in disarray. [Root.GetRulerName] has been named successor, after having managed to gather enough support among the military on [Root.Capital.GetName], but the situation remains tenuous and pretenders are attempting to gather enough support to challenge the new [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s rule."
 
 pretender.1.desc_04:1 "The flesh of [From.GetRegnalName] has failed, and our algorithms have been unable to identify an optimal replacement. To maintain efficiency a new [Root.GetRulerTitle] has been chosen at random, and it now falls on [Root.GetRulerName] to interpret the infallible will of the Main Computer.\n\nDoubts have been raised, however, and there are those who see themselves as better qualified to perform this honor."
 
 pretender.1.desc_05:1 "[From.GetRegnalName] has passed away and the entire [Root.GetName] is in mourning. There is sadly no declared heir, and this has raised some contention among the nobility.\n\n[Root.GetRulerName] has already been crowned on [Root.Capital.GetName], but Pretenders claiming distant kinship with [From.GetRegnalName] has challenged the new [Root.GetRulerTitle]."
 
 pretender.1.tooltip:1 "Pretender factions have arisen."
