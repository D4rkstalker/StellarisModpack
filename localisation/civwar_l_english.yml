 civwar.1027.name:1 "§RGeneral Declares Independence!§!"


 # Faction Leader General
 civwar.1027.desc:0 "To become the leader of a political party in a nation as large as ours is no small feat, and requires a vast array of political connections and support. General §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! is no exception in that regard. While the §Y[civil_war_party.GetName]§! party has a decent amount of support, they have seen little progress in achieving their policy goals. Frustrated by the lack of government support for their party's agenda, General §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has left their post and leveraged their political connections on a planet where their party had a large amount of support to seize control of the planet and it's neighrboring systems. With solidified support, General §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has declared themselves the leader of a new government based on the planet. They've also managed to commandeer a certain amount of our fleet, and have the support of enough of their populace that should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

Scientist §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! is no exception in that regard.

 # Admiral Rebellion
 civwar.1029.name:1 "§RAdmiral Declares Independence!§!"


 # Faction Leader Admiral
 civwar.1029.desc:0 "To become the leader of a political party in a nation as large as ours is no small feat, and requires a vast array of political connections and support. Admiral §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! is no exception in that regard. While the §Y[civil_war_party.GetName]§! party has a decent amount of support, they have seen little progress in achieving their policy goals. Frustrated by the lack of government support for their party's agenda, Admiral §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has seized complete control of their fleet. While most captains and crew were loyal to the state, the Admiral had positioned trusted §Y[civil_war_party.GetName]§! party members in key ships throughout the fleet. Even so, there was still a struggle, and around a third of the fleet's ships were lost. With solidified support, Admiral §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has declared themselves the leader of this fleet-state. They've claimed the system that they were in and it's neighboring systems as their own."

 # Sector Rebellion

 civwar.1030.name:1 "§RGovernor Declares Independence!§!"

 # Corrupt Governor
 civwar.1030.corrupt.desc:0 "There had long been whispers that Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! was involved in the criminal underworld of their sector, but official investigations into the matter had never been able to turn up conclusive proof. Unfortunately, the rumors have turned out to be true, and it seems that profiting off of their position as Governor was no longer enough for them. Assassinations of key sector officials by gangs in the last day and bribes made over the past few months have given Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! enough support to declare themselves the leader of their own independent nation. It also appears that the governor had been convertly diverting funds from their sector into the creation of a fleet that is loyal to them alone. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 # Righteous Governor
 civwar.1030.righteous.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has long been known as a person of the highest character. Unfortunately, it appears that their high moral fiber combined with disagreements over some of our policies has led them to believe that their sector would be best if governed fully under their authority. As such, they've leveraged their popular support within the sector to declare themselves the leader of an independent nation. It also appears that their popularity extends deep through their sector's military personnel. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

  # Veteran Governor
 civwar.1030.veteran.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§!'s long history of military service to our nation is well known. They've overseen the training of many thousands of cadets, and have been crucial to the strengthening of our armies. Unfortunately, it seems that a part of that training involved instilling a greater loyalty in the cadets towards the governor than towards the state. Leveraging their extensive network of loyal army contacts, Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has taken near complete control of their sector and declared themselves the leader of a new, independent nation. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 # Officer Governor
 civwar.1030.officer.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§!'s career as an admiral in our fleet is well known. They've personally overseen the training of hundreds of crews in our fleet.Unfortunately, it seems that a part of that training involved instilling a greater loyalty in the crews towards the governor than towards the state. Leveraging their extensive network of loyal fleet contacts, Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has taken near complete control of their sector and declared themselves the leader of a new, independent nation. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 # Slaver Governor
 civwar.1030.slaver.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§!'s efficient use of slave labor was one of the primary factors in their selection as governor. By placing their own personal slaves in key positions throughout their sector, they were able to more effecitvely maximize the output of their sector, which was greatly beneficial to our nation as a whole. Unfortunately, this made it trivial for the governor to signal their slaves to send the taxes and resources of their sector's systems directly to them, which they have just done. They have declared themselves the leader of a new independent nation. With the amount of slaves they have at their disposal, should we not accept their independence, there will be war."
