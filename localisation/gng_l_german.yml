 qbricks.1000.name: "The Next Phase"
 qbricks.1000.desc: "The [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have begun using new techniques to utilise fire, manufacture better tools and weapons and mine useful minerals. They have also taken a lot more interest in our observation units and there have been a few attempts to damage them or move them, with the expected results - failure.\n\nThe units still contain a lot of useful data. We could retrieve them, or activate their self-destruct routines, or leave them on [From.GetName] in case we can still make use of them in the future.\n\nHowever, at this stage of their development, the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] would be very difficult to manipulate with the devices in any useful way."
 qbricks.1000.a: "Retrieve the units."
 qbricks.1000.b: "Activate their self-destruct routines."
 qbricks.1000.c: "Leave them on the planet."

 qbricks.2000.desc: "Now that the observation units on [From.GetName] have been established for a while, we can make some changes to their settings to influence the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] behaviour or make the land around the units more fertile. We could: "

 # War between nations!
 qbricks.3100.name: "There Is Only War!"
 qbricks.3100.desc: "[From.GetName] is ablaze with war between every nation. There are no civilians anymore, other than a few children being placed in isolation for breeding and training, for reinforcements that will inevitably be needed.\n\nThere have been a few rare cases where a small group of [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] appear to be unaffected by the Conflict-makers but they are either quickly wiped out by hostile forces, or vanish to remote regions of the planet."
 qbricks.3100.a: "Excellent progress."
 qbricks.3100.b: "This will eventually make them stronger."
 qbricks.3100.c: "What have we done?"
 # Rapid weapons advancements
 qbricks.3200.name: "A Sharper Sword"
 qbricks.3200.desc: "[From.GetName] is ablaze with war between a half-dozen continental alliances. However, the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have gone to considerable lengths to fight with honour and to keep civilians out of the conflict. The fact they are using diplomacy alongside battle suggests iron wills that will not resort to barbarism or pure uninhibited hatred.\n\nThis has also given them the spare [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName]-power and time to advance their military technologies. Their weapons and armour are now mass-produced by specialists and are mostly of good quality. Siege weapons are becoming more complex. Ships are getting sturdier with every construction project.\n\nThey even have medical specialists treating the wounded and improving their bio-sciences.\n\nIt looks like war is making most nations excel in the very art of making it."
 qbricks.3200.a: "The [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] may prove very useful."
 qbricks.3200.b: "Excellent progress."
 qbricks.3200.c: "This might have been a mistake."

Almost all [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have become very docile.\n\nA small percentage of the population continue to work on farms producing enough food to sustain small communities that don't seem to do much of anything else other than eat and sleep.\n\nAnother group takes advantage of those unwilling to let the majority starve, focusing on accumulating personal wealth and power."
 qbricks.4100.a: "Excellent progress."
 qbricks.4100.b: "This is how society should work."
 qbricks.4100.c: "Is this what we intended?"
 # Unity and unification

 qbricks.4200.desc: "The Peacemakers have made [From.GetName] a highly productive and united world. [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have ceased fighting over resources, land, and other material things.\n\nInstead every [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] strives to excel at doing something to contribute to society and community, usually something they have natural talent for.\n\nThere are some [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who have gained a higher status in society because of their skills contributing to maintaining the peace, co-operation, arbitrating the few disagreements that come up, and improving the productivity of all [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] for the benefit of all on [From.GetName].\n\nCurrency, material gain and economics have become a minor triviality in the day-to-day routines of the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName]."

 qbricks.5300.name: "Many Farms"
 qbricks.5300.desc: "Farming on [From.GetName] is rapidly spreading and related technologies are advancing. Many [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have abandoned other trades to focus on working the fields and handling livestock.\n\nMethods of storing and preserving foods have improved considerably. There has also been a population boom."
 qbricks.5300.a: "Excellent progress." 
 # Industrial stagnation
 qbricks.5500.name: "Mineless"
 qbricks.5500.desc: "Other industries on [From.GetName] are vanishing, replaced by land clearance and agricultural development. The [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] show little interest in acquiring minerals needed to improve buildings and tools, and prefer to make do with what they have."
 qbricks.5500.a: "Interesting."
 # Agricultural advances
 qbricks.5700.name: "Even More Farms"
 qbricks.5700.desc: "Farms on [From.GetName] continue to appear across the planet as more land is cleared and made more fertile by crude but effective techniques developed by the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. The population continues to boom.\n\nThe observation units' fertilising routines appear to be quite redundant now, their benefit no longer needed."

 # Scientific curiosity of units - materialism up
 qbricks.8200.name: "Smarts"
 qbricks.8200.desc: "Many [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] on [From.GetName] have shown increased scientific curiousity of the observation units and most have concluded that they have been placed upon their planet by a highly advanced species that probably lives somewhere beyond the bounds of [From.GetName].\n\nConsidering the primitive state of their science and technology, this is a definite indication of already considerably advanced intelligence in the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."

 # Successful reverse-engineering of unit - rapid and sudden tech advance and potentially even communication!
