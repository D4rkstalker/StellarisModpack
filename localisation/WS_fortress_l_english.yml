####TECHNOLOGIES#########
 tech_WS_gateways: "Advanced Gateway Construction"
 tech_WS_gateways_title: "§HUnlocks Megastructure:§! Gateway construction in Wild Space"
 tech_WS_gateways_desc: "Extensive experimentation and analysis of the gravitational peculiarities of unstable hyperlanes in Wild Space has enhanced our understanding of the Gateway network. We can now build modified Gateways in unclaimed Wild Space."

 tech_WS_Fortress: "Deep Space Fortress"
 tech_WS_Fortress_title: "§HUnlocks Station:§! Deep Space Fortress"
 tech_WS_Fortress_desc: "These massive installations are like cities floating in space. They can support a crew of thousands, operate independently in Wild Space and are often equipped with firepower rivaling that of a fleet."

 tech_WS_Fortress_cap: "Deep Space Fortification Protocols"
 tech_WS_Fortress_cap_desc: "Advanced construction and maintenance protocols to allow construction and management of additional §YDeep Space Fortresses§!."
 WS_fortress_capacity_increase_title:0 "§YDeep Space Fortress§! capacity: §G+1§!"
 WS_fortress_capacity_increase_desc: "Empire capacity for §YDeep Space Fortress§! is increased by §G+1§!"


######## MEGASTRUCTURES #####

   WS_gateway_0: "Gateway Construction Site"
   WS_gateway_0_DESC: "The initial site will serve as the base for the construction of a future Gateway."
   WS_gateway_final: "Gateway"
   WS_gateway_final_DESC: "A conduit through the very fabric of subspace that enables rapid travel to other Gateways."
   WS_gateway_final_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS:0 "Cannot build a Gateway too far beyond the gravity well of a system"

  WS_anchor_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS: "An artificial gravitational anomaly being used to stabalise the hyperlanes in this sector."
   WS_anchor: "Hyperlane Anchor"
   WS_anchor_DESC: "An artificial gravitational anomaly being used to stabalise the hyperlanes in this sector."
