  ## Decisions

  decision_build_stargate:0 "Build Stargate"
  decision_build_stargate_effects_short:0 "Build a stargate and make it active on this world."
  decision_build_stargate_desc:0 "Stargates, also called Astria Porta in Ancient and Chappa'ai in Goa'uld, as well as various other names across the universe, are a series of devices built by the Ancients which create wormholes, allowing for near-instantaneous transportation between two distant points in space."

  ## Deposits

  d_stargate_excavation:0 "Excavation Site"
  d_stargate_excavation_desc:0 "A small archaeological site has discovered something amazing. It's a large circular monolith, 6.7 meters in diameter..."

  d_stargate_command_desc:0 "Command centre of all stargate activity in the country."

  d_active_stargate:0 "Stargate"
  d_active_stargate_desc:0 "Stargates, also called Astria Porta in Ancient and Chappa'ai in Goa'uld, as well as various other names across the universe, are a series of devices built by the Ancients which create wormholes, allowing for near-instantaneous transportation between two distant points in space."

  ## Special Projects

  STARGATE_IMMERSION_ARCHAEOLOGY:0 "Aid from the scientific community"
  STARGATE_IMMERSION_ARCHAEOLOGY_DESC:0 "We have promised to aid the §EStargate§! project. Let us begin.\n\nWill unlock the technology §Y$tech_stargates_archaeology$§!"

  STARGATE_IMMERSION_EXPERIMENTATION:0 "Aid from the scientific community"
  STARGATE_IMMERSION_EXPERIMENTATION_DESC:0 "We have promised to aid the §EStargate§! project. Let us begin.\n\nWill unlock the technology §Y$tech_stargates_experimentation$§!"

  STARGATE_IMMERSION_BREAKTHROUGH:0 "Aid from the engineering community"
  STARGATE_IMMERSION_BREAKTHROUGH_DESC:0 "We have promised to aid the §EStargate§! project. Let us begin.\n\nWill unlock the technology §Y$tech_stargates_breakthrough$§!"

  ## Static Modifiers

  planet_active_stargate:0 "Active Stargate"
  planet_active_stargate_desc:0 "This planet has an active Stargate, which enables instantaneous travel to other worlds."

  ## Technology

  tech_stargates_archaeology:0 "Archaeological Improvements"
  tech_stargates_archaeology_desc:0 "Thanks to our stargate discoveries, we have already made some improvements to our archaeological procedures. With this push - who knows what we can accomplish?"

  tech_stargates_experimentation:0 "Stargate Experimentations"
  tech_stargates_experimentation_desc:0 "Matter transmission is a three-step process: dematerialization, transmission, and reintegration. When an object passes through the event horizon, it is dematerialized and held in a "hyperspatial buffer". The event horizon will only dematerialize objects in discrete units (one person, one ship, etc.), so any object which has not fully entered the event horizon can be removed without trouble."

  tech_stargates_breakthrough:0 "Building Stargates"
  tech_stargates_breakthrough_desc:0 "The Stargate creates a stable, artificial wormhole between itself and another Stargate, allowing near-instantaneous travel from the dialing gate to the destination gate, but not vice versa. When a given address is inputted, the dialing gate connects to the receiving gate over a subspace link and quickly exchanges precise locational details, then establishes a stable wormhole between them."
