 anomaly.2550.desc:0 "While conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] detected the remains of an automated shipyard in orbit. It is at least a thousand years old and seems to have been subjected to a heavy missile barrage, but one of its manufacturing bays is still in working condition.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is confident that power can be restored to the shipyard, but it would be a significant project.We will need time to study the structure and create new drawings"
 anomaly.2551.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has successfully restored power to the automated shipyard over [From.From.From.GetName]. The facility immediately resumed its interrupted construction order, using what materials it had on hand to build three advanced raiders of an unknown design.\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient facility broke down completely afterwards and has been deemed beyond repair. We have sent crews to the new ships and commissioned them into our fleet.We will need time to study the structure and create new drawings"
