If it was not for our detector itself, the crashed spacecraft might still not be completely damaged."

Fortunately, with the constant repair of $sr_living_metal$ and $nanites$ that make up the spacecraft, we can still roughly identify some of these structures today, an ancient singularity core that is about to run out, and something that could be an accessory to the AI that maintains the ancient spacecraft.\n\nCurrently, our [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologyTeam] is conducting salvage restoration and research work on the salvaged wreckage, but unlike those ancient wreckage found in space, this ancient wreckage is so badly damaged that our [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologyTeam] and [Root.Owner.GetScienceTeam] None were optimistic about the study."

Based on the only discoveries so far, our [Root.Owner.GetScienceTeam] speculates that the crashed spacecraft is some kind of engineering facility used by the ancient civilization, but its full picture, specific use and other information may never be known except for the crashed spacecraft itself.\n\nWhen our archaeological work was about to come to an end, §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! made an unexpected discovery, compared with some of the space station structure repaired by our [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologyTeam], and our previous research results on ships and space stations of other ancient civilizations, this ancient spacecraft seems to be missing the core and some auxiliary equipment of ancient AI. Based on repeated analysis of the state of preservation of ancient AI debris, §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes that the missing parts may not have been completely destroyed when the spacecraft crashed or with the geological activity of §H[From.Planet.GetName]§!, but may have separated from the spacecraft itself before the ancient spacecraft entered the atmosphere of §H[From.Planet.GetName]§!.\n\n§H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that although there is little hope, it is possible to find these lost devices in the interstellar space around §H[From.Planet.GetName]§!"

The box has some kind of device similar to a subspace beacon, but this beacon has been out of work for a long time, and there are still signs of ablation on it. After conducting initial research on the box, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] found that the box had a simple shield generator, which may be one of the reasons why the number of traces of cosmic ray damage to the box seriously does not match its age, but the shield failed about hundreds of thousands of years ago.\n\nOur [Root.GetScienceTeam] found in this box a component of an ancient AI, where a piece of memory contained information about something called §HAuto Construction Template§!, which our [Root.GetScienceTeam] believes may be related to some advanced auto-construction technology.\n\nBased on the information pieced together from the memory of the ancient AI, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] believes that this AI came from an ancient spacecraft that crashed into the planet, and the spacecraft appeared to be attacked by something recorded as §HFourth-Class Psionic Blast§!, followed by a gradual loss of stability in orbit and eventually crashed on the planet. The ancient AI separated itself from the so-called §HAuto Construction Template§! from the space station before the spacecraft fell, and the AI itself was attacked again after the separation, falling in §H[ag_target_moon.GetName]§!, and that §HAuto Construction Template§!, may still be floating somewhere in interstellar space."

Our [Root.GetScienceTeam] believed that the crash we found to the ancient spacecraft may have the corresponding construction equipment, but we are stuck in the fact that we can't see it for real time.\n\nA number of existing research results show that the automatic construction template we found can adapt well to our current level of space construction technology, and can effectively optimize the construction process such as star base and star ring base, eliminating many redundant steps, which allows us to build starbases or orbital rings in batches according to the specified template."
