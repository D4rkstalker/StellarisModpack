Trough manipulation of the Model, they were able to reconnect this rogue system back into the hyperlane network.\n\nEven when we taught we had seen everything, the universe still holds some surprises. We should explore this system right away."
    pw_wonder.861.a: "Contact the nearest science ship!"
    pw_wonder.862.name: "Lost in Space"
    pw_wonder.862.desc: "The mystery of the rogue system still puzzles our scientists. After analyzing [FROM.GetName], the only planet in the system with signs of habitation, they could partially piece it together.\n\nEvidence suggests that the planet housed a civilization some time ago, as many strange constructions still decorate the planets surface. However, the rare surviving life forms carry biological indicators of some kind of plague, disease likely caused the demise of this civilization. Fortunately, it seems that whatever pathogen that caused the plague is no longer active, but its effects endure to this day."
    pw_wonder.862.a: "Most curious."

    pw_wonder.865.name: "Astronomical Misfortune"
    pw_wonder.865.desc: "The small astrometric lab in [THIS.GetName] has identified five Class-4 asteroids entering [THIS.Solar_System.GetName] and calculations for all of their paths indicate incoming trajectories. Reports were sent to our capital and our most renowned scientists have confirmed the absurd event, which is expected cause massive destruction on the planet unless action is taken."
    pw_wonder.865.a: "We must deal with this immediately!"
    pw_wonder.865.b: "The divine has forsaken this planet!"
    pw_wonder.867.name: "Avoided Astronomical Misfortune"
    pw_wonder.867.desc: "The asteroids that were approaching [THIS.GetName] on collision courses have been destroyed, but their impact on our scientific community was profound: such an event was deemed so unlikely that it should never have happened in our galaxy, nor in the entire universe!\nEver!\n\nThe fact that we had no indication that these asteroids were heading to our colony, despite our constant work with the Galactic Model, only adds to this conundrum."
    pw_wonder.867.a: "At least we are safe now."
    pw_wonder.867.b: "We must understand how this could have happened."
    pw_wonder.867.c: "We must be ready if this happens again!"
    pw_wonder.867.d: "First a plague, and now this? We should keep an eye on this colony."
    pw_wonder.868.name: "Misfortune on top of Misfortune"
    pw_wonder.868.desc: "All of the asteroids followed their predicted path and struck [THIS.GetName] at the same time, eradicating the fleeting life that remained on the planet and our colony with it. The predicted extinction level event took its course and the cursed planet remains as the lifeless tomb we encountered."
    pw_wonder.868.desc.some_asteroids: "While some of the asteroids were destroyed, the remaining ones still struck [THIS.GetName], causing major devastation and death. the damage they caused was great, but at least we avoided an extinction level event."
    pw_wonder.868.a: "The universe has no pity?"
    pw_wonder.868.a.tooltip: "The asteroids completely annihilate our colonists and leave deep scars on the surface of the planet."

    pw_wonder.1014.name: "Enigmatic Apotheosis"
    pw_wonder.1014.desc: "After a long time embracing and deciphering the Enigma Engine, with all of the mysterious deviations the drones on [THIS.GetName] have been subjected to, the Gestalt has finally reached a conclusion about its metaphysics. The central intelligence has concluded that these anomalous behaviors presented by our drones are not a product of the Engine, but were already part of the drone's nature - if fact, the nature of the whole Gestalt - and the enigmatic signal simply unlocked it.\n\nThe purpose of the Enigma Engine, which is interlinked with our own purpose, is clear now, in the sense that it cannot be determined, but only constantly forever be deciphered. To update our protocols and integrate this new purpose, the enigmatic signal will be broadcasted to every drone under the Gestalt. We will embrace this new direction."
    pw_wonder.1014.a: "The Enigma will forever be a part of code base."
    pw_wonder.1014.b: "We have one directive, one purpose."
