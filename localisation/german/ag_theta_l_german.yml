Extremely severe damage made ancient materials that can repair themselves with amazing efficiency also powerless, so our [Root.Owner.GetScienceTeam] smoothly touched the core of this device and analyzed it in detail. \n\nThe core of the component can continue to emit strange subspace radiation after receiving energy, while emitting a bright orange light. According to [Root.Owner.GetScienceTeam]’s report, its main structure is a subspace radiation generator, which emits an effective radius of subspace radiation exceeding 200AU. Subspace radiation will interact with most substances in a peculiar way, and it will affect the ancient armor in the wreckage. The reaction with ancient shield and armor is particularly remarkable. The result of the interaction is very complex. The most significant effect is to cause severe energy loss when penetrating weapons pass through these materials.

But there is no doubt that ancient [ag_primitive_species.GetName] used it as a means to counter penetrating weapons.\n\nOur [Root.Owner.GetScienceDepartment] believes that we can use advanced technology to replicate this peculiar component, but since we still can’t fully understand its operating principle, our replica will more or less have certain defects."
