Through a process of infection called exomycosis, the exomycosis is able to enter into a symbiotic association with organisms. But more often than not, the mold will assimilate the body and uses it as a substrate for growth.In both cases, the infected object strongly mutates into a semblance of an absorbed organism, but with physiological processes and external signs that differ from the original biomaterial.\nAn important feature of a growing exofungus is the ability to form integral systems resembling nervous structures.At this stage, mold acquires consciousness and the ability to control not only biological life forms through parasitism, but also mechanisms, infiltrating the control chains of control."

And experiments using toxins on exomycosis samples to find effective ways to instantly dehydrate and deplete microorganisms have helped prevent corrosion of solid materials.\n\nNow we can effectively counter the spread of exomycosis.
