 personality_map_insidious_opportunists:0 "Insidious Opportunists"
 personality_map_insidious_opportunists_desc:0 "Insidious Opportunists are superficially cordial, which belies their true nature as ambitious manipulators who fear costs of conflict, and thus will instead make 'friends' only to further their own self-interest.

 personality_map_outcast_pariahs:0 "Outcast Pariahs"
 personality_map_outcast_pariahs_desc:0 "There is simply no polite way to put it. Outcast Pariahs are ugly. Or, at the least, others find them ugly. Yet, they have learned to embrace this ugliness. They are a society that values strength and honor, courage and power and deal fairly with those are fair to them in return, whether as friend or foe."
 personality_map_surgeons_of_beauty:0 "Surgeons of Beauty"
 personality_map_surgeons_of_beauty_desc:0 "Surgeons of Beauty are obsessed with the power of beauty.

 personality_map_valiant_hearts:0 "Valiant Hearts"
 personality_map_valiant_hearts_desc:0 "Peace through war. An oxymoronic statement, but Valiant Hearts truly believe in it. They have seen the devastation and cruelty that war can bring.
