While they were already visible from space, these vast energy grids proved quite the mystery. Surrounding the massive energy networks are the ruins of crumbling buildings, broken roads, and not much else. It is clear a vast and powerful civilisation once resided on this world and used these energy networks not only to transfer power from one city to another, but also everything else, from street lamps to individual rooms. Due to this, the structures are visible even from orbit.\n\nOur scientists are unable to determine what materials comprise these grids, despite thorough investigation. It seems to be a combination of a translucent material core surrounded by a liquid layer of crystals with some form of super-resistant outer layer made from unknown components.\n\nInitial studies lead us to believe that these vast networks are powered by giant thermal plants deep within the planet's crust. Unfortunately, the vast thermal vents these networks eventually lead to are too deep and too hot to currently explore. Our scientists are certain that these networks should be compatible with our own energy systems with some minor modifications. "
