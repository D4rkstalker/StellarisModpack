Completing each special project will provide a certain progress for the current research project. Only when the progress of the research project reaches the required progress, the research project will be carry out. \n\nBecause research projects require a lot of resources, our [Root.GetScienceDepartment] can only conduct one research project at a time. Choosing a new research project will §Ysuspend§! the current research project, progress of current progress will be §Ycompletely saved§!. \n\nA research project may involve §Yresearch in multiple fields§!, and its special project will also randomly consume §Yresearch points§! in the corresponding field. When the special project is completed, the progress we can obtain is determined by the §Yleader§! in the research field corresponding to the current special project. The §Ghigher §!the leader's §Ylevel§!, the §Gmore§! progress we may get. \n\nWhen the six special plans included in a research project are completed, if the progress of the research project has not reached the required progress to complete it, our [Root.GetScienceDepartment] needs to sort out the results we have achieved so that it can be used in the next research. Unfortunately, some existing progress of this process will usually §Rlost§!, if there is a §Yleader§! on the ship that executing the research project, the leader’s §Ylevel§! will help to §Greduce§! the progress we lost in sorting research results. \n\nThe §Ydifficulty§! of the research project will affect the progress we can obtain each time, and it will also affect the progress we may lost if the research project is not completed.
