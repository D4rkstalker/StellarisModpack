  fatalf.054.title:0 "The L-Gates Reactivate"
  fatalf.054.desc:0 "Interestingly, each currently activated L-Gate has begun to emit a series of pulses, and your sensors pick up that the galactic hyperlane network has begun to decay. The cause seems to be coming from every L-Gate in the galaxy, which means that until an empire manages to control each gate to study, the hyperlanes will continue to change unpredictably."
  fatalf.055.title:0 "Hyperlane Disruption"
  fatalf.055.desc:0 "Now that the L-Cluster has been opened, the L-Gates are beginning to come online at full-power. But strangely, your long-range sensors are detecting a series of large pulses coming from them that is disrupting the hyperlane network. If we wish to find the cause, we will need to control each galactic L-Gate."
  fatalf.057.title:0 "The Hyperlane Machine"
  fatalf.057.desc:0 "Controlling each L-Gate has revealed to you the secrets of the hyperlane disruption. It seems that each L-Gate has a signaller that is part of a large machine which siphons energy from the natural hyperlane bypasses. They are sending the energy into a significantly different orientation than the natural occurances. Should the machine be activated to full power, it would change the galactic landscape, yet also reveal some pristine systems that have lost their hyperlane connection."
  fatalf.059.title:0 "Unexpected Systems"
  fatalf.059.desc:0 "Several systems that have been completely undetected before have suddenly appeared around the galaxy. Interestingly, each one seems to consist of many suns, and no planets, habitable or otherwise."

  fatalf.259.desc:0 "Our passive scanners have indicated that a new hyperlane is appearing soon between [fatalf_hyperlane_1.GetName] and [fatalf_hyperlane_2.GetName]. It will only be stable for a limited time, so we should take advantage while we can."

  fatalf.071.title:0 "???"
  fatalf.071.desc:0 "I am [lost_country.GetRulerTitle] [lost_country.GetRulerName] of the [lost_country.GetName]. Please pardon our sudden arrival, but time was of the essence, and our empire was far too lost to help, so we fled through a dimensional rift we were researching. From what we see, we are you, but traveled along a different path, so we hope that you will assist us. We have far too many citizens, and far too few resources. Will you help us?"
  fatalf.071.response:0 "Our technology had advanced to a similar point as yours not too long ago when we made a grave mistake. A certain harmful fungus that we were studying had achieved rapid mutation into a sort of deadly pathogen. By the time we discovered the cause, our entire empire was affected. We were able to create a vaccine for the few who still lived, and spent all of our remaining resources finding a way through the rift we previously discovered."

  fatalf.072.desc_01:0 "You accepted new arrivals from the [lost_country.GetName] into your empire. They are extremely grateful, and promise to live their role in society, whatever it may be. The rest of the population has set out through the galaxy to expand."
  fatalf.072.desc_02:0 "You gave some of your hard-earned resources to the [lost_country.GetName]. They are extremely grateful, and set off through the galaxy to expand, now that they have the materials to do so."
  fatalf.072.desc_03:0 "You provided nothing to the [lost_country.GetName]. They understand, though they are not happy about it. They set off into the galaxy, ready to rebuild their empire."

  fatalf.075.desc:0 "With absolutely no forewarning, your Scientist has reappeared on the §Y[Root.GetName]§!. When questioned about where they disappeared to, they tell tale of how they were mysteriously transported to the surface of a pristine, perfect planet. While there, they considered that there was likely a natural wormhole with an extremely high uncertainty and predictability within the system, and with the right efforts, we could stabilize it and travel to that planet."
  fatalf.076.title:0 "Wormhole Stabilization"
  fatalf.076.desc:0 "We have managed to temporarily stabilize the wandering wormhole, and now all that remains is to send our ships through. There is no guarantee it will stay open after the first use, so we must prepare all that we can for our first force."
  fatalf.077.title:0 "Energy Release"
  fatalf.077.desc:0 "Shortly after our ships pass through the wormhole, it closes and emits a large burst of energy throughout the system that disrupts sensors all over the galaxy. All ships we had in the system have disappeared. Strangely though, the wormhole has grown to a size expected of a natural one, become properly stable, and leads to somewhere new. Will we ever see our colonists again?"
