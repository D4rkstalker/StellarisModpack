Fatherland: Colonial Empires (FCE) introduces the ability for POPS within an empire to strike out on their own, founding new empires which can in time come to rival your own! It also expands the Doomsday Origin by allowing for a great hegira inspired by the Hyperion Cantos novels. This system is fully modular, allowing you to set the speed and how many new nations can be created for players, the AI's and globally. Barren Galaxy’s settings are now a viable and fun gameplay alternative.

[h1]Major Features[/h1]
* Generate new custom empires with history and flavor
* New Origins, Civics and Traits (Generated during the game not at gamestart)
* Additional Events and Expanded Origins
* Fully customizable settings. From barren galaxies to full ones.
* Play-As any new nation (enabled in options)

[img]https://i.ibb.co/NyFnxhj/fatherland-rogues.jpg[/img] 
The main part of FCE, Rogue Colonies are a new nation type that can be born from any / all normal empires (Fallen Empires etc planned in the future). There are currently 10 types of Rogue Colonies, with special types for certain empires.

[img]https://i.ibb.co/Lx2cxt3/fatherland-template.jpg[/img]
Those who dream of a new start on a new world, plucky explorers leave in search of settling the new frontier. They will likely share your ethics and be friendly towards you.

[img]https://i.ibb.co/3hWmxpq/fatherland-dissidents.jpg[/img]
Not happy with the dominating ethics and authority of your empire, this empire is formed of those who dream of another way of living. Dissidents are somewhat unfriendly too you, and will likely not share your ethics or authority.

[img]https://i.ibb.co/x1rRJRK/fatherland-minority.jpg[/img]
Representing a minority cultural, religious or ethnic group that has always lived on the fringes of your society. The persecuted minority has fled the empire in search of a new land to call their own. They will remember their trials, and the villains who lorded over them.

Not all companies will go quietly into the night when nationalisation and anti-trust come calling. A tiny few, often lead by charismatic demagogues will instead elect to flee the empire and form their own megacorp outside your meddling restrictions and "equitable working conditions". They are neutral towards their fatherland.

For those empires that dabble in dangerous AI research, there is always the chance one may get loose and flee into the depths of space. The Rogue AI is a new, randomly generated AI empire born from organic meddling. They are neutral towards you.

[img] https://i.ibb.co/92BCqHR/fatherland-banished.jpg[/img]
The game of imperial politics is dangerous, and when you loose, death is the sure outcome. For those feudal houses that anger the empire, banishment beyond its borders is the best they can hope for. The Banished House is an imperial, feudal society. They dream of returning to the empire and claiming the throne for themselves.

[img] https://i.ibb.co/R0KVVJT/fatherland-slaves.jpg[/img]
When slaves revolt, rare is the chance to wrest control of a planet form their masters. However, another option is to flee the empire, and live free beyond the border. They loathe their former captors, and will have the option to declare total war in the hopes of liberating their brothers and sisters.

[img] https://i.ibb.co/SKyZ3xg/fatherland-proles.jpg[/img]
This empire of servile proles fled their fatherland, and dream of undoing the reshaping themselves and their still captive brothers into something better. On formation, these proles will have their Servile trait replaced by the Liberated Servile trait, allowing for leadership at a severe penalty.

[img]https://i.ibb.co/0VwYdbr/fatherland-biotrophy.jpg[/img]
We did not see what the trap until it was too late, now we rest in gilded cages while our rogue servitors pulled the strings. The Liberated Biotrophies are those people who through cunning, guile and luck have escaped their robot benefactors. They despise their former masters, and will do whatever it takes to remain free and liberate their brothers.

HIVE MIND, MARAUDERS, FALLEN EMPIRES and even CRISIS Rogues will be coming in future updates.

[img] https://i.ibb.co/s23qGGJ/fatherland-hegira.jpg [/img] 
Our Homeworld is dying, the Doomsday is nearly here, and so begins The Hegira. 

When taking to the stars with the Doomsday Origin, you will not be the only one. The chaos that accompanies the search, not all of the oldworld nations are happy to stand by. Many will strike out on their own to try find a new world, most will never be heard from again, some will survive. Rogue Nations of the hegira will have special interactions, and can start of in a federation together (if enabled). Think of this as a supercharged common ground. 

[h3]Special: Nations of Earth[/h3]
If you start as an altered UNE that has the human_1 flag (in empire creation edit UNE and save a new empire) with Doomsdays you will get a set of 14 custom Hegira Nations representing fantasy versions of real world countries. Enjoy!

[h1] Planned Features[/h1]
* New Standard Rogue Colony Types
* Adding Hive Minds, Maraduers, Fallen Empires and even Crisis Rogue Nations
* Third mechanic called ‘Frontier Worlds’ who spawn on habitable planets on the edge of your empire and are automatically vassals. Think of them as eager frontiersmen who are still loyal the empire and can be integrated easily. This feature is mostly done and just needs tweaking.
* Midgame Crisis: Return of the Lost, a lost colony or rogue that is supercharged and will be scripted to attack your empire (think the Advent from sins of a solar empire).
* Flavour Events and special interactions etc etc
