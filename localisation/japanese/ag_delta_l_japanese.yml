Although the progress is very slow, they have finally achieved some results. As a result of some form of calamitous event, these ancient weapons were not put into actual use by their creators. Seeing as many of their systems were not well protected by any of the weapons we found in the vessel, it is unlikely that the Ancients ever felt a need for sufficient security systems to be utilized to bring ruin to the efforts of the likes of us - as such, the incomplete security systems in many areas of the vessel may provide us a rare opportunity for us to break through its defenses.

Unfortunately, this is not without any downside - The repairs draw power from the reserves normally dedicated to weaponry, leading to a noticeable decrease in the output of the ship’s weapons for a short period after activation. \n\nAs we do not yet fully understand how the repair mechanism works, we are unfortunately unable to replicate it for use in other vessels.
