 eev_tower_city.1.desc: "从这颗气态巨行星的深处，我们最好的护盾会在永无止境的磁暴的漩涡迷雾中失效，出现了一个巨大的金属和混凝土圆柱体。更令人兴奋的是顶部的城市废墟柱子的位置。还有两边各处悬挂的村庄。探索这个地方需要一些资源，所以决定在城市的一个空地上准备一个大本营，开始探索。"

 #考古遗址从这里开始
 eev_tower_city_dig: "不可能的城市"
 eev_tower_city_dig_desc: "我们的科学团队正在忙着建立一个大本营。由于到处都是破败的建筑物，要取得进展需要大量的钻探和巩固，但这个地方的奥秘让团队渴望开始。"

 eev_tower_city_dig.1.name: "探索城市"
 eev_tower_city_dig.1.desc: "我们的团队现在准备探索这个奇怪的地方。塔的上半部分位于舒适区的中间，那里的大气压力和温度使它适合居住。城市废墟覆盖了大部分圆柱体的顶部，当然是他们会找到最有价值数据的地方——没有人愿意下去探索柱子两侧的垂直村庄之一。"

 eev_tower_city_dig.2.name: "过去的奥秘"
 eev_tower_city_dig.2.desc: "我们的第一次发现相当混乱。这座城市的居民显然处于前空间技术水平，由于他们不可能的家园完全缺乏资源，他们显然被困在这个水平上。这提出了更多的问题。他们不可能建造柱子，那么是谁建造的，如何建造的？原始人是如何来到这里生活的？"

 eev_tower_city_dig.3.name: "闯入"
 eev_tower_city_dig.3.desc: "科学小组来到一座宏伟的建筑前，虽然部分毁坏，但仍然气势磅礴。闯入后，他们发现了第一批人形居民的遗骸，并留下了一些成员进行采样分析他们。继续前进，§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!进入了某种限制区域。扫描表明内部仍然完好无损，但在破碎的天花板和加固的墙壁之间，这需要一些工作才能进入."

 eev_tower_city_dig.4.name: "被战争破坏"
 eev_tower_city_dig.4.desc: "我们终于进入了内部掩体，发现了一台与整个圆柱体相连的巨大计算机——第一个收集到的数据足以让我们头晕目眩。它不是一个巨大的柱子，而是一个泰坦尼克号的摩天大楼。在一场彻底破坏他们社会的残酷内战之后，内部很久以前就被遗弃了。他们变得越来越原始，装备年久失修。最后在地表漫游的部落已经无法理解他们的旧技术了，当最后的合成器停止工作时，它们很快就结束了。"
 eev_tower_city_dig.4a: "一个悲惨的故事。"
 eev_tower_city_dig.4t: "这座古老的建筑是一项工程壮举，它将让我们的科学家忙上几个世纪。"

 eev_scanned.1.name: "外星探测器"
 eev_scanned.1.desc: "一个来历不明的探测器突然不知从何处出现并开始扫描我们的船。§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! 将 §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! 的扫描仪对准了探测器，但是"它以不可能的速度消失了。对我们可以收集的仅仅几秒钟的数据的分析表明，它使用的技术与将我们的舰队从崩溃的能量​​漩涡中拯救出来的未知船只相同。"
 eev_scanned.1a: "他们的技术远超我们所知。"
 eev_scanned.1b: "他们的技术是一种不可接受的威胁。"

#远古回声
 eev_ancient_echoes_category: "远古回声"
 eev_ancient_echoes_category_desc: "我们飞船的仪器检测到从 §Y[From.GetName]§! 上方的维度裂缝中涌出的超光速粒子。§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! 已决定从安全距离发射探测器以收集 尽可能多的数据。"

 eev_ancient_echoes.1.desc: "我们的探测器在裂隙外记录了一个可怕的场景:两支伟大的外星舰队正在展开一场凶猛的战斗，使用强大的武器。能量的闪光像一千个太阳一样照亮了整个系统，因为它们分散在看似 坚不可摧的护盾。然后，一股集中的火焰撕裂了一艘主力舰的防御系统，击中了它的反应堆。接下来的爆炸使我们的探测器失明，当仪器恢复时，裂缝消失了。后来对恒星位置和超光速粒子能量位置的分析 一百万年前的战斗。"

# 神秘的缓存
 eev_mysterious_cache_category: "神秘缓存"
 eev_mysterious_cache_category_desc: "我们的传感器发现了从 §Y[From.GetName]§! 发出的微弱信号。靠近之后，§B[Root.GetFleetName]§! 发现它是从一座孤零零地矗立在这个荒凉世界的古老建筑中发出的."
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.name: "来自过去的礼物"
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.desc: "进入这座建筑很困难，因为它有很厚的墙，没有入口。这些墙保护着一个小房间，里面有一个中央祭坛，上面有一个华丽的盒子。扫描显示这座建筑和盒子里有十一个几千年前，但祭坛上有我们现代语言的铭文！更令人不安的是，他们准确地命名为§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!，说这个盒子是给 [Root.GetHerHim] 的礼物。盒子非常重，考虑到它充满了一种未知的合金，它肯定会被证明是有用的，并且会给我们的科学家一些工作。但是谁送来了这个礼物，他怎么知道我们会来？"

# 坠毁的殖民船
 eev_crashcol_category: "金属碎片"
 eev_crashcol_category_desc："我们飞船的传感器在§Y[From.GetName]§! 的表面检测到一些金属碎片。团队正准备进行一次远征调查。"
 eev_crashcol.1.name: "坠毁的殖民船"
 eev_crashcol.1.desc："科学考察队发现了一艘来历不明的古代殖民船的残骸。它比我们的设计大几倍，几千年前坠毁在高原上，杀死了所有乘客。计算机被完全摧毁， "我们无法确定它的来源。不过，这块巨大残骸的船体是由有用的合金制成的，所以他们放置了一个灯塔，以便以后进行回收探险。"
 eev_crashcol.2.name: "恢复完成"
 eev_crashcol.2.desc："一支恢复探险队刚刚从坠毁的殖民船返回，船上装满了合金。这肯定对我们的帝国有用。"

 supernova.5.name: "Massive plasma vortexes"
 supernova.5.desc: "Our science ship has observed the most violent and massive plasma vortexes ever spotted in a star. This phenomenon is generating extreme waves of radiations but §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s shields support their assault. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! announced that this star will probably explode in a supernova before the next millennia. The crew has collected some exciting data that will have an important impact in physics research."

 unstable_gas.2.name: "Plasmoid gathering"
 unstable_gas.2.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the ship detected the presence in the atmosphere of the gas giant of a great herd of plasmoid beings. They are consuming the hydrogen of the giant planet, igniting it with their extreme temperature. At this rate, it will take them a few centuries to consume it before they leave §Y[From.GetName]§! to find a new pasture."

 boom_asteroid.2.name: "Malfunction"
 boom_asteroid.2.desc: "As the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! crew went in for a closer examination of the metallic structure they triggered an extremely loud alarm. The alarm had begun counting down from 30 seconds when the crew spotted huge nuclear devices. That's when they knew they were in trouble. \n\nThe crew had to think quick and attempted to disarm the devices, but they were all written in some alien language nobody understood. \n\nSoon after, the countdown ended... and nothing happened. Fearing that it could trigger at any moment, the crew returned hastily to the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!"
 boom_asteroid.1.a: "At least everyone is safe."

# Country Events
 murder_event.9.name: "Invisibility armor analysis"
 murder_event.9.desc: "Our scientists have made progress in analysing the murderer's strange armor. They confirm that it uses a technology that is far beyond our own. They are trying to devise a sensor capable of detecting it but it is going to be complicated."
 murder_event.9.a: "Spare no effort!"

 murder_event.10.name: "Disturbing discovery"
 murder_event.10.desc: "Our science team has made a discovery while analyzing the murderer's armor. Its energy source emits a faint radiation that defies all analysis, but it is not totally unknown to us. It's the same radiation that our fleets have detected from the enigmatic alien ships they encountered. But those weren't hostile..."
 murder_event.10.a: "Strange... Keep analyzing the data, we must have missed something."
 murder_event.10.b: "I knew they were dangerous! Keep analyzing the data, we must find their weakness."

 eev_new_queen.1.name: "A perturbation in the Network"
 eev_new_queen.1.desc: "Your Mind feels uneasy these times. Something is odd within the great networks that links you to your drones, but you can't find what is wrong. And as time passes, the feeling is becoming stronger."
 eev_new_queen.1.a: "Distraction can't be allowed"
 eev_new_queen.1.tt: "Your Mind will focus on the Network to find the source of the disturbances."

 eev_new_queen.2.name: "Source discovered"
 eev_new_queen.2.desc: "The disturbances in our network were faint at start, but they kept becoming stronger. You finally found the cause: somehow, one of your drone has mutated, its mind becoming independent and expanding its will. The impossible happened: a new Mind is claiming your very Network as its own."
 eev_new_queen.2.a: "This is intolerable. Kill it by any means necessary."
 eev_new_queen.2.b: "Isolate the mutant drone and study it."
 eev_new_queen.2.c: "Deviation is food."

 eev_new_queen.3.name: "Clear Network"
 eev_new_queen.3.desc: "Stopping the mutant drone was not an easy task, as some of your drones switched sides as they approached it. Focusing your Mind like you never did, though, you managed to overcome its grip and regain control of them. It's being disposed as you wanted, but something alerted your drones as they found some strange vials containing a swirling liquid. You know everything that is built in your hive, and this is not one of them."
 eev_new_queen.3.a: "Who's interfering with us?"

 eev_afraid.1.desc: "Among the few remaining traces of the fallen civilization that once inhabited this planet, we found a buried vault containing historical records. It turns out that these people lived in constant fear of their own sky, believing that death could come from the stars at any moment. They never tried to go to space, and died when some hostile alien force bombed the surface for years."
 eev_afraid.1a: "They were right."
 # Expanding the Crushed event.
 crushed.1.desc.phobe: "While investigating the planet the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! landed on a very small - and somewhat intelligent - civilization. \n\nWhen the ship landed on the civilization they crushed 90% of the population.

 eev_scifi.1.name: "Impossible designs"
 eev_scifi.1.desc: "The fact that a computer system survived this long on this desolate world is a miracle. There is sadly no information on the fate of this lost civilization, but the computer is full of designs of impossibly massive megastructures, some of them spanning many solar systems? Our scientists are becoming extremely excited as the incredibly advanced schematics are transmitted back to our empire. It is only after weeks of exhausting work that one of the crew members discovers that the computer was only hosting a database related to a very popular science-fiction series."
 # Unsavory Scientist
 eev_unsavory_scientist: "Emerging structures"

 eev_misplaced.1.desc: "As per routine, our scientists have very carefully landed on §Y[From.GetName]§! in a very remote location to gather some samples for future research of how these aliens live. \n\nOne scientist however misplaced some equipment, including a gun, on the planet's surface. \n\nThe team's lead scientist assures us that everything will be fine and during our next inspection of §Y[From.GetName]§! they will retrieve her weapon."

 eev_misplaced.3.name: "Misplaced Equipment: Part II"
 eev_misplaced.3.desc: "Our scientists have returned on §Y[From.GetName]§!. Only this time with hopes that they could find some missing equipment. \n\nThey didn't find anything; however, they did notice the natives' footprints scattered around as if they were having a party, or in some way frantically worshiping our scientists equipment."
 eev_misplaced.3.a: "We should stop landing here."

 eev_misplaced.5.name: "Misplaced Equipment: Part III"
 eev_misplaced.5.desc: "Once more, our scientists have landed on §Y[From.GetName]§!. Except this time they were greeted, and quickly surrounded by the local natives. One such native held the lost gun. He looked more regal than the rest. Perhaps he has become a king of sorts on this planet because of his new found power. \n\n All at once they started rambling and screaming in their native language. The message was clear, to never come back. \n\nThe team quickly retreated and left the planet with haste."
 eev_misplaced.5.a: "Perhaps it's better to study them from afar."
 eev_misplaced.5.b: "Kill those who oppose us. Big or small."

 eev_losing_nerves.2.desc_mil: "Despite their primitive technology, the natives of §Y[eev_lostnerves.GetName]§! destroyed the life pod before our scientist could even get out of it. They will gain a limited insight from the remaining debris, but the damage is still important."
 eev_losing_nerves.2.desc_phobe: "The natives of §Y[eev_lostnerves.GetName]§! were quite horrified by our scientist's appearance and opened fire by pure instinct. They brought back the lifepod to a scientific compound. This will have a huge impact on this society."
 eev_losing_nerves.2.desc_phile: "Our rogue scientist on §Y[eev_lostnerves.GetName]§! has been located, completely ignored by the natives as a festival involving grotesque disguises is going on. We can take advantage of it if we act quickly enough."
