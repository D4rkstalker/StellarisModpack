The ancient engineering project we found is called \"§HNebula§!\". Its goal should be to design a series of weapons that can effectively suppress low-level technology civilizations, but this project seems to be of little importance to the Ancient Civilization, and it was aborted long before it could be completed, leaving only a few prototype weapons. The series of hostile ancient forces that we encountered in §H[ag_ancient_delta_star.GetName]§! are likely to be part of this project. \n\nFor some reasons that we don't know yet, the Ancient Civilization decided to keep a lot of relevant data after the Nebula Project was suspended. Our [Root.GetScienceTeam] needs some time to analyze these data, but they will always complete the task."
