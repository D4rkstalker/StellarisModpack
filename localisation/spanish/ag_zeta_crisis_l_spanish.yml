Conventional matter will be shredded during the passage, and only objects with special psionic structures can pass normally. But in a sense, our model also shows that these portals will become more stable while shredding material or absorbing energy, which means that we can stabilize them by attacking these psionic portals. \n\nAround these psionic portals, our [Root.GetAstronomyDepartment] found a large number of smaller objects, most likely entities composed of psionics, and preliminary contact reports indicated that they were hostile to ships that were trying to approach to them."

However, the $ag_divine$ was not completely destroyed, and some of their collective consciousness remained in the $ag_shroud$. In the middle, these remaining consciousness are the earliest Shroud Invaders. \n\nMy creators established many psionic conduits to connected with the $ag_shroud$ when conducting psionic experiments, and used these psionic conduits to obtain energy through the $ag_shroud$. A large amount of energy flow attracted the attention of the $ag_divine$’s residual consciousness, and they hoped to use the energy of my creator to rebuild themselves. Soon after the Shroud Invaders began to use these energy, the creators noticed that the energy would be stolen by certain entities in the $ag_shroud$ when it passed through the $ag_shroud$. They underestimated the Shroud Invaders’ ability and just built some psionic security system to prevent this energy from being stolen. \n\nThe creators' method is quite effective. The Shroud Invaders cannot get the energy in the psionic conduit because they don't have enough energy to destroy the security system in the $ag_shroud$, and of course they will not give up because of this. It took a long time for the Shroud Invaders to infiltrate the psionic network used by the creators, using the creators’ psionic energy to create powerful destructive psionic entities, trying to destroy the physical structures of the psionic security system in our world, a war broke out between the creators and them.
