 eev_houston_category: "Energy Vortex"
 eev_houston_category_desc: "§B[Root.GetFleetName]§! has encountered a powerful energetic anomaly in close orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! decided to begin an analysis of this strange energy vortex."
 eev_houston.1.name: "[Root.owner.Capital.GetName], we have a problem."
 eev_houston.1.desc: "Bad news! The scan disturbed the vortex, sending a powerful energy wave that disrupted the ship's engines. The §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! is slowly drifting towards the gravity well of the planet.\n\nWithout repairs, it will crash into §Y[From.GetName]§!."
 eev_houston.1a: "Send a construction ship at once!"

 eev_houston.2.name: "Rescuing the science ship"
 eev_houston.2.desc: "Our constructor was working hard to repair §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! when the vortex erupted again, disabling the ships! Both crews are working frantically to repair their systems while their ships are getting closer to the planet. Our military ships have reinforced systems and better shields, they should be able to handle this, but if they don't, we will lose another ship."
 eev_houston.2a: "Have a military ship haul them to safety."
 eev_houston.2b: "We can't take the risk."

 eev_houston.3.name: "Left without repairs"
 eev_houston.3.desc: "The crew of §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! acknowledged the bad news and use their remaining time to gather as much data as they can. They were about to send a report when the anomaly erupts again. We would have lost our construction ship if had sent one. Our military ships have reinforced systems and better shields, they should be able to handle this, but if they don't, we will lose it."

 eev_houston.4.name: "Military to the rescue"
 eev_houston.4.desc: "Our military ships met with §B[eev_vortex_sci.GetFleetName]§! and our constructor and started hauling them far from the orbit of §Y[eev_vortex_pla.GetName]§!. The vortex exploded again but our guess was right: our fleet only suffered some minor malfunctions, and their redundant systems immediately kicked in. But a few minutes later, §G[eev_vortex_sci.GetLeaderName]§! warned that the anomaly's instability was now critical and urged the fleet to speed up, but before they could escape, the vortex finally imploded, and an enormous blast of energy was the last bit of information we got before losing all communications from [From.System.GetName]."
 eev_houston.4a: "This is bad..."

 eev_houston.5.name: "Military to the rescue"
 eev_houston.5.desc: "Our military ships met with §B[eev_vortex_sci.GetFleetName]§! and started hauling it far from the orbit of §Y[eev_vortex_pla.GetName]§!.

 eev_houston.6.name: "No rescue"
 eev_houston.6.desc: "The last transmission we received from §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! was the final gigantic destruction of the energy vortex as the ship started to enter the atmosphere of §Y[From.GetName]§!. There's no way they could have survived that."
 eev_houston.6a: "The universe is a dangerous place."

 eev_houston.7.name: "Rescue from out there"
 eev_houston.7.desc: "To the surprise of [Root.owner.Capital.GetName] control center, we received a transmission from our lost ships! They are all safe and excitedly reported an incredible story.\n\nAs they thought to be doomed, an alien ship of unknown design emerged from nowhere and shielded them from the full strength of the explosion. Then it used some energy beams to repair the damaged ships before disappearing at an incredible speed.\n\n§B[Root.GetFleetName]§! systems could only scan it for a few seconds, revealing that the strange ship wasn't using any known means of propulsion."
 eev_houston.7a: "Concerning..."
 eev_houston.7b: "We have friends out there."

 eev_houston.8.name: "Rescue from out there"
 eev_houston.8.desc: "To the surprise of [Root.owner.Capital.GetName] control center, we received a transmission from our lost ships!

 eev_houston.9.name: "A parting gift."
 eev_houston.9.desc: "As §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! was conducting an evaluation of §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s systems after the recent events, he discovered a hidden block of scientific data in the ship's computer. He's adamant that it wasn't here before the incident and it probably comes from the strange ship. After a thorough analysis, he declared the data totally safe and published it."

 eev_houston.11.name: "Scientist lost"
 eev_houston.11.desc: "We've just learned that our scientist §G[eev_vortex_sci.GetLeaderName]§! has suddenly died despite his perfect condition. Our medical team detected strange radiations emanating from [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] body, but they quickly faded."

 EEV_SCI_REPAIR: "Repairing the science ship"

# Unexpected tower, alias Farewell Horizontal
 eev_tower_city_category: "Unexpected tower"
 eev_tower_city_category_desc: "Our sensors have picked up something unexpected in this gas giant: a monumental tower is emerging from the clouds."

 eev_tower_city.1.name: "Giant tower"
 eev_tower_city.1.desc: "From the depths of the gas giant where our best shields would fail in the swirling mists of a neverending magnetic storm, comes a huge cylinder of metal and concrete. What's even more exciting is the city ruins on the top of the pillar. And the villages hanging on various places on the sides. An exploration of this place would require some resources and it was decided to prepare a base camp on an open area of the city to start an exploration."

 # Archaeology site starts here
 eev_tower_city_dig: "The impossible city"
 eev_tower_city_dig_desc: "Our science team is busy establishing a base camp. Due to the crumbled buildings everywhere, progress will require a lot of drilling and consolidations, but the mysteries of this place make the team eager to start."

 eev_tower_city_dig.1.name: "Exploring the city"
 eev_tower_city_dig.1.desc: "Our team is now ready to explore this strange place. The upper half of the tower is at the middle of the comfort zone where the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere makes it habitable. The city ruins covers most of the top of the cylinder, and is certainly where they will find the most valuable data - noone wants to go down to explore one of the vertical villages on the sides of the pillar."

 eev_tower_city_dig.2.name: "Mysteries of the past"
 eev_tower_city_dig.2.desc: "Our first discoveries are quite confusing. The inhabitants of the city were clearly at a pre-spatial technology level, and they were clearly stuck at this level due to the total lack of resources of their impossible home. This raises even more questions. They couldn't have built the pillar, so who did it and how? And how did the primitives came to live here?"

 eev_tower_city_dig.3.name: "Breaking in"
 eev_tower_city_dig.3.desc: "The science team arrived in front of a great building, still imposing despite being partially ruined. After breaking in, they discovered the first remains of the humanoid inhabitants and left behind a few members to take some samples and analyze them. Progressing further, §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! entered some sort of restricted area. Scans indicate that the interior is still intact, but between the crumbled ceilings and the reinforced walls, this will require some work to gain access to it."

 eev_tower_city_dig.4.name: "Broken by war"
 eev_tower_city_dig.4.desc: "We finally gained access to the interior bunker and found a huge computer that's connected to the whole cylinder - and the first gathered data is enough to make our head spin. It isn't a massive pillar, but a titanic skyscraper. The interior was abandoned long ago after a brutal civil war that totally broke their society. They became more and more primitive as their equipment fell in disrepair. The last tribes that roamed the surface weren't able to comprehend their old technology anymore, and when the last synthesizers stopped working, their end came soon after."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4a: "A tragic tale."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4t: "The ancient building is a feat of engineering that will keep our scientists busy for centuries."
 eev_tower_city_dig.4b: "We're sitting on a huge pile of alloys."

 # Scanned
 eev_scanned_category: "Scanned"
 eev_scanned_category_desc: "Our ship has arrived in orbit of a promising planet and has started scanning it. We expect to have some interesting results very soon."
 eev_scanned.1.name: "Alien probe"
 eev_scanned.1.desc: "A probe of unknown origin suddenly appeared from nowhere and started to scan our ship. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! pointed the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s scanners on the probe but it disappeared at an impossible speed. The analysis of the mere seconds of data we could gather shows that it uses the same technology than the unknown ship that saved our fleets from the collapsing energy vortex."
 eev_scanned.1a: "Their technology is far beyond anything we know."
 eev_scanned.1b: "Their technology is an unacceptable threat."

# Ancient Echoes
 eev_ancient_echoes_category: "Ancient Echoes"
 eev_ancient_echoes_category_desc: "Our ship's instruments have detected an influx of tachyons emanating from a dimensional rift above §Y[From.GetName]§!. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has decided to launch a probe from a safe distance to gather as much data as possible."
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.name: "Battle from the past"
 eev_ancient_echoes.1.desc: "Our probe recorded a frightening scene beyond the rift: two great alien fleets are engaged in a ferocious battle, using weapons of incredible strength. Flashes of energy illuminate the whole system like a thousand suns as they disperses on seemingly impenetrable shields. Then, a concentrated fire tore through the defenses of a capital ship, hitting its reactor. The following explosion blinds our probe, and when the instruments recover, the rift has disappeared. Later analysis of the star positions and the tachyons' energy place the battle over a million years ago."

# Mysterious Cache
 eev_mysterious_cache_category: "Mysterious Cache"
 eev_mysterious_cache_category_desc: "Our sensors have spotted a faint signal emanating from §Y[From.GetName]§!. Moving closer, the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! discovered that it's emanating from an old building that stands alone on this desolate world."
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.name: "A gift from the past"
 eev_mysterious_cache.1.desc: "Entering the building proved difficult as it had very thick walls and no entrance. These walls were protecting a small room that contained a central altar with an ornate box on it. Scans indicate the building and the box are eleven thousands years old, but the altar has inscriptions in our modern language! More troubling is that they precisely name §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, saying that the box is a gift for [Root.Leader.GetHerHim]. The box is incredibly heavy, considering that it's full of an unknown alloy that will certainly prove useful and give our scientists something to work on. But who made this gift, and how did they know we would come?"

# Crashed colony ship
 eev_crashcol_category: "Metallic debris"
 eev_crashcol_category_desc: "Our ship's sensors have detected some metallic debris on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. The team is preparing an expedition to investigate."
 eev_crashcol.1.name: "Crashed colony ship"
 eev_crashcol.1.desc: "The scientific expedition discovered the remnants of an ancient colony ship of unknown origin. Multiple times bigger than our designs, it crashed on a plateau a few millennia ago, killing all its occupants. The computers are completely destroyed and we can't determine its origin. The hull of this massive wreckage is made of useful alloys though, so they placed a beacon for a later recovery expedition."
 eev_crashcol.2.name: "Recovery completed"
 eev_crashcol.2.desc: "A recovery expedition just came back from the crashed colony ship with its hold full of alloys. This will certainly prove useful for our empire."

# Start menu
 eev_start_menu.1.name: "Configuration"
 eev_start_menu.1.desc: "Do you want to activate or deactivate the most destructive events? These can destroy planets or entire systems."
 eev_start_menu.1.START: "Start the game"
 eev_start_menu.1.no_kaboom: "§GDeactivate§!"

 eev_start_menu.1.kaboom: "§RActivate§!"
 eev_start_menu.1.kaboomTT: "This will §Rallow§! the destructive events to happen."

# Anomalies - alternate endings
 supernova.5.name: "Massive plasma vortexes"
 supernova.5.desc: "Our science ship has observed the most violent and massive plasma vortexes ever spotted in a star. This phenomenon is generating extreme waves of radiations but §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!'s shields support their assault. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! announced that this star will probably explode in a supernova before the next millennia. The crew has collected some exciting data that will have an important impact in physics research."

 unstable_gas.2.name: "Plasmoid gathering"
 unstable_gas.2.desc: "§G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the ship detected the presence in the atmosphere of the gas giant of a great herd of plasmoid beings. They are consuming the hydrogen of the giant planet, igniting it with their extreme temperature. At this rate, it will take them a few centuries to consume it before they leave §Y[From.GetName]§! to find a new pasture."

 boom_asteroid.2.name: "Malfunction"
 boom_asteroid.2.desc: "As the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! crew went in for a closer examination of the metallic structure they triggered an extremely loud alarm. The alarm had begun counting down from 30 seconds when the crew spotted huge nuclear devices. That's when they knew they were in trouble. \n\nThe crew had to think quick and attempted to disarm the devices, but they were all written in some alien language nobody understood. \n\nSoon after, the countdown ended... and nothing happened. Fearing that it could trigger at any moment, the crew returned hastily to the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§!"
 boom_asteroid.1.a: "At least everyone is safe."

# Country Events
 murder_event.9.name: "Invisibility armor analysis"
 murder_event.9.desc: "Our scientists have made progress in analysing the murderer's strange armor. They confirm that it uses a technology that is far beyond our own. They are trying to devise a sensor capable of detecting it but it is going to be complicated."
 murder_event.9.a: "Spare no effort!"

 murder_event.10.name: "Disturbing discovery"
 murder_event.10.desc: "Our science team has made a discovery while analyzing the murderer's armor. Its energy source emits a faint radiation that defies all analysis, but it is not totally unknown to us. It's the same radiation that our fleets have detected from the enigmatic alien ships they encountered. But those weren't hostile..."
 murder_event.10.a: "Strange... Keep analyzing the data, we must have missed something."
 murder_event.10.b: "I knew they were dangerous! Keep analyzing the data, we must find their weakness."

 eev_new_queen.1.name: "A perturbation in the Network"
 eev_new_queen.1.desc: "Your Mind feels uneasy these times. Something is odd within the great networks that links you to your drones, but you can't find what is wrong. And as time passes, the feeling is becoming stronger."
 eev_new_queen.1.a: "Distraction can't be allowed"
 eev_new_queen.1.tt: "Your Mind will focus on the Network to find the source of the disturbances."

 eev_new_queen.2.name: "Source discovered"
 eev_new_queen.2.desc: "The disturbances in our network were faint at start, but they kept becoming stronger. You finally found the cause: somehow, one of your drone has mutated, its mind becoming independent and expanding its will. The impossible happened: a new Mind is claiming your very Network as its own."
 eev_new_queen.2.a: "This is intolerable. Kill it by any means necessary."
 eev_new_queen.2.b: "Isolate the mutant drone and study it."
 eev_new_queen.2.c: "Deviation is food."

 eev_new_queen.3.name: "Clear Network"
 eev_new_queen.3.desc: "Stopping the mutant drone was not an easy task, as some of your drones switched sides as they approached it. Focusing your Mind like you never did, though, you managed to overcome its grip and regain control of them. It's being disposed as you wanted, but something alerted your drones as they found some strange vials containing a swirling liquid. You know everything that is built in your hive, and this is not one of them."
 eev_new_queen.3.a: "Who's interfering with us?"

 eev_quantum_god.1.desc: "An ancient civilization thrived here until a massive solar flare sterilized their world. Surprisingly, they were equally religious and science-inclined, having decided that their god both existed and didn't exist until they had a definitive answer to that question. Sadly, before they could find it, their entire civilization died when their sun erupted."

 eev_afraid.1.name: "Afraid of the Stars"
 eev_afraid.1.desc: "Among the few remaining traces of the fallen civilization that once inhabited this planet, we found a buried vault containing historical records. It turns out that these people lived in constant fear of their own sky, believing that death could come from the stars at any moment. They never tried to go to space, and died when some hostile alien force bombed the surface for years."
 eev_afraid.1a: "They were right."
 # Expanding the Crushed event.
 crushed.1.desc.phobe: "While investigating the planet the crew of the §B[Root.GetFleetName]§! landed on a very small - and somewhat intelligent - civilization. \n\nWhen the ship landed on the civilization they crushed 90% of the population. Those who remain did not look happy as they were throwing grains of rock at the scientists feet. \n\nThese survivors were incinerated by our ship's thrusters when the team left with a valuable shiny object."

 eev_scifi.1.name: "Impossible designs"
 eev_scifi.1.desc: "The fact that a computer system survived this long on this desolate world is a miracle. There is sadly no information on the fate of this lost civilization, but the computer is full of designs of impossibly massive megastructures, some of them spanning many solar systems? Our scientists are becoming extremely excited as the incredibly advanced schematics are transmitted back to our empire. It is only after weeks of exhausting work that one of the crew members discovers that the computer was only hosting a database related to a very popular science-fiction series."

 eev_misplaced.5.name: "Misplaced Equipment: Part III"
 eev_misplaced.5.desc: "Once more, our scientists have landed on §Y[From.GetName]§!. Except this time they were greeted, and quickly surrounded by the local natives. One such native held the lost gun. He looked more regal than the rest. Perhaps he has become a king of sorts on this planet because of his new found power. \n\n All at once they started rambling and screaming in their native language. The message was clear, to never come back. \n\nThe team quickly retreated and left the planet with haste."
