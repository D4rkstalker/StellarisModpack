Our [Root.GetScienceDepartment] cannot find any explanation for the magical properties of these man-made structures. At present, we can only think that the original owners of these man-made structures may have a technological level much higher than ours.\n\nOur [Root.GetScienceDepartment] believes that only further investigation of these man-made structures can obtain more information."
