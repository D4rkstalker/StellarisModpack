Several high-pitched roars echoed across the hive as the biological layer covering the incubation chamber ruptured and a thick, purple, ooze started leaking. Shortly afterwards the top of the hive started opening and several small creatures emerged from the chamber and flew straight towards the science team. It appears they are not hostile and seem to show an unselling attachment to the scientists."
