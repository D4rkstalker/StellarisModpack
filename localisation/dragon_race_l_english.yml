trait_dragonbody_desc:0 "This species is a diverse collection of winged reptiles consisting of many subspecies. Some can breath fire, other's ice, and still others can spit acid or venom. Some can camouflage their scales and others have natural night-vision. They are huge, comparable to whales, and require significantly more food to sustain themselves, though many of them being cold blooded helps with this, their size also causes slow population growth. Their unique skills combine with their imposing physical size and strength to make them excellent in combat while still maintaining incredible intelligence. Their diversity of sub-species makes colonization of alien worlds easy in all but the most extreme cases. Finally, they live extremely long lives, a single dragon may see multiple eras."
