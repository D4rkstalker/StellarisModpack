 EMPIRE_DESIGN_saurischian1_desc:0 "Astroraptors are a vain and contentious race of predators. Their entire history is an endless cycle of military advancement and escalation of rivalries between the Megapacks dividing their homeworld. \n \n With the discovery of space travel by one of the many warlords, global unity was finally achieved, as the other packs decided to find common ground with their rival in order have access to the newly discovered hyperlane. \n \n The Glorious Crescent had been created."
 START_SCREEN_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "It was only a matter of time before we learned how to fly into space. \n \n Now, with gravity no longer defying us, and world-ending technology at our disposal, the great destiny of our marvelous species shall be fulfilled. \n \n The entire Galaxy shall witness the awesome power of the [Root.GetName]!"
 SPC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "What's up, [From.GetRandomSpeciesSound] vermin? I am aware that the sight our glorious form is the only spark of awe-inspiring marvel in your otherwise pathetic, empty existance, but I have other things to do today."
 SPC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Hope you're readying your fleets, we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] prefer our preys feisty. It wouldn't really be much of a sport if you just crumbled upon our very arrival, would it?"
 SPC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We didn't destroy any of your moons, you cretinous [From.GetSpeciesClass], why are you even bringing this up? ...Ah! I think it bought it. ...What do you mean the translator is still on? Meh, whatever."
 SPC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Oh, SORRY, I wasn't quite sure you were an ACTUAL interstellar Empire. You gave me more the vibe of subspacial smudge. *snicker* Very well, I'll allow you to entertain me for a few moments."
 SPC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Failing-Empire-doomed-to-extinction says what?"
 SPC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Who are you [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] again? I swear, I got it on the tip of my tongue... It's.. it's.. nah, it's just chewed-out finger. Sorry, you were saying?"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Greetings, you incorregible [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! I'm sure we'll have a great time hating each other in the near future."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Ugh, you again. What is it now? I'm in the middle of something."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Do you want the [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s autograph? I could arrange something, but how many planets of delicious- I mean, prestigious [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are you willing to give me access to in return?"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Our studies show that [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are three times more likely to keep listening to messages clearly devoid of any meaningful content than the average xeno."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Curses, there's that pesky interference covering the video agai- Oh, wait, no, that's just your face. Do you need to talk about something?"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Have you ever considered how obscenely disproportionate your arms are, [From.GetSpeciesName]? And the way they bend.. it's just gross."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "The bald monkey is back on, guys! Come, quick, before it turns off the channel!"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "For pure academic research, would you be interested into providing our little [Root.GetSpeciesName] kids with some ripe [From.GetSpeciesName] females? We want to study how much drinking sweet mammalian milk affects [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] growth. "
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "Hi, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. I want to have put on the record that I find you outrageously fluffy and plushy, and would like to squeeze you until all your cute little entrails are turned into mush you're so pretty."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "Got eggs, [From.GetSpeciesName]? I heard your species reproduces by laying particularly big eggs. Big, sweet, delicious eggs."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_11:0 "You know what? You might not be so bad after all, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Those scales give you just the right kind of crunchiness."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_12:0 "Rumors about [From.GetSpeciesAdj] researchers claiming that our two species share uncanny similarities have reached us. Are you kidding me? How are [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ANYTHING like [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? We don't even have feathers! Feathers are lame."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_13:0 "What do you need feathers for when you have hyperdrive, am I right? Yep, of course I am. Shut up, we're not jealous."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_14:0 "I have to admit it, [From.GetSpeciesName] you have to be one of the weirdest things we've aver taste- I mean encountered. Yes, I think that should work."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_15:0 "Are you one of those hive mind-kind of people? Can never tell if I'm talking to the same guy or just the ten-millionth drone of the day relaying message from the consciousness or whatever. Not gonna refer to you with the Royal We either way, though."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_16:0 "Yakh, is that jelly normal, or are you just happy to see me?"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_17:0 "Hello, [From.GetSpeciesName], I'm- I want to- Guys, sorry, I can't do it. ...Does someone else want to talk to the big blob on the holoscreen? Anybody? Come on, guys!"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_18:0 "I was wondering, [From.GetSpeciesName], is what you have contagious, or something? As a purely hypothetical scenario, if I were to eat y- hm, nah, that sounds suspicious. If I were to eat a PIECE of you, would I get sick?"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_19:0 "Gah. I don't even want to know what is the translator translating right now. Do you even talk? Squirt? Splurt? Psh, I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore..."
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_20:0 "Hello, [From.GetSpeciesName], what do you- Ugh, come on now, seriously, is this a joke? It's not funny anymore! Just come out from behind that stupid plant and let's talk face to face. I know we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are intimidating, but this is just ridiculous!"
 SPC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_21:0 "Greetings, most honored collegue. I am pfft- quite honored to- to receive your distinguished call that k'k'k'kh!- \n Please, do tell me what you wish to discuss- as equaah ah ah ah! ...Come on guys! I was trying to make it feel better about itself!"
 SPC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "You think you're so tough? How about you decommission all of your fancy ships and we settle this on the ground, face to hideous face? We'll see who laughs then we will!"
 SPC_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Your fleets don't scare us! As [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] we relish the challenge of a strong foe!"
 SPC_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Is this it? Do you want to do this? We'll do this. Oh, don't you worry, we're more prepared than you might think to tackle with the likes of you."
 SPC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Hey, look who's there! It's you! ..That guy. I totally know your name. And really like what your doing with your worlds."
 SPC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Who's a good boy? You are! Yes you are! Wait, sorry, were you a chick? I can never tell with your kind. Anyway, any important diplomatic business to go through?"
 SPC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "We can count the creatures who truly understand the magnificence of the [Root.GetName] on the tip of our tongue. And they are the ones that we don't usually swallow. So, consider yourself pretty lucky."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "I have to tell you, on behalf of all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] I represent, you're doing great. A wonderful militaristic performance. You truly are a powerful opponent. This is totally not sarcasm."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "This conversation is totally not a ploy to keep your channels busy while we prepare our next strike. Please stay on until the next pre-recorded message."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Have you called to exchange prisoners? Would you be satisfied with a two-[From.GetSpeciesName]-limbs-per-[Root.GetSpeciesName] ratio? We're open to counter-offers."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Your kind is so delicious, we can even eat you raw, it's amazing! We should do this more often."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "You can spare me the puppy eyes, fluffy-boy, they only make you look more tasty. *wink* *wink*"
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "Can't you step it up? I would expect a little more from the likes of you, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_07:0 "I swear, plucking your prisoners for the roast is more trouble than its worth. Unless you do it when they're still alive. Then it becomes HILARIOUS."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_08:0 "I have to say it is somewhat comical the number of times that our forces have accidentally squashed yours, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_09:0 "What do you think will happen when our vicious, devastating armies will meet your wobbly, gelatinous blob? Are you sure you thought this through? Then again I am still not sure that you've got a brain in that poor excuse of a head."
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_10:0 "Our media outlets are still not sure on whether to address our current engagement as a war, or as a routine sanitization. Got any insightful suggestion on the matter?"
 SPC_WAR_GREETING_11:0 "Oh, look! It's the terrible [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! I guess if I lay still for a good two decades one of your warriors could manage to grow around my neck. Maybe. Uh, I'm so scared!"
 SPC_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Yes, yes, what have we done now that you don't like? Don't you even have a shred of sense of humor? It wasn't even an endangered species or anything!"
 SPC_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "What? We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] haven't done anything. It was totally somebody else. Not that we wouldn't know what it is."
 SPC_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "Must you call us so often? Do you WISH to cause diplomatic incidents?"
 SPC_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "Sup, [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. You get steamrolled now. 'Kay thanks bye."
 SPC_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "We're kind of bored, and you look kind of tasty. How about we set up a w- ah, nevermind. The fleets have already departed. Don't really need your permission."
 SPC_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "Say, that's a wonderful set of planets you have there... It would be a real shame if somebody came in and messed your systems. I think what you need is some good ol' fashioned [From.GetSpeciesAdj] protection."
 SPC_DOW_PROPOSE_04:0 "Hey there. It's that time of the decade already. Mind if we crash in? Wait. Don't answer. We like surprises."
 SPC_DOW_PROPOSE_05:0 "You have holomail from [From.GetName] \n \n -Invading now. \n \n Ta ta"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "You know what they say about people with short sickles..."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Do you work hard to be such a pathetic disappointment of an Empire, or is it just one of your core ethics?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] sure are proof against evolution. If survival of the fittest applied universally, you'd be long extinct. Then again, there's still time..."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and the Blorgs, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!"
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "There comes a time when an intergalactic power must look inside, and attempt- look at the abject- Ah, screw this! You suck! End of transmission."
 06_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "You are as much overrated as K'reel, and WAY less articulated."
 07_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Random Reviled Historical Figure of your past that you are ashamed of did NOTHING wrong, and you'd be better off if he or she was still in charge."
 08_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Is your baldness inherited or are you so ashamed of your filthy, mammalian hair that you shave it every day, monkey?"
 09_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Oh, look! It's a flat-faced, plug-nosed, child-caring, tiny-eyed, even-fingered, breast-feeding, dish-eared, clawless, jawless, tailess, round-headed, balding monkey!"
 10_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Look at you. You're pathetic. Who could ever be scared by something as tiny and fluffy as you are?"
 11_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Guess spending all your childhood with your [Root.GetSpeciesMouthName] glued to your mommy's breast gave you lots of experience at sucking, [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult], yes?"
 12_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "This little [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult] is getting shot in the face, and this little [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult] is going to be spaced, and this little [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult] is going to be roasted in my hoven, and this little [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult] is still too stupid to understand I'm just insulting it, and this l-"
 13_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Being cold-blooded doesn't make you cool-blooded, if you know what I mean, [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]..."
 14_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Look how long and stiff is my tail, [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. I could smash a skull with it. I bet none of your pathetic little snakeish mongrels that you call people have anything so big and hard."
 15_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "We may not see it eye to eye, [Root.GetSpeciesName], but we can at least find common ground in how marvelous and colorful our scales are. ...I'm messing with you. Your scales stink. I mean, look at you! You look like you've been painted with fruit juice or something. Look at it! It's laughable!"
 16_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Feathers are lame, and so are you. More to be said? Don't think so."
 17_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Oh, look at me, I'm a [Root.GetSpeciesName]! I've got just two big teeth over my entire mouth, because that's as far as I can count!"
 18_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "On [From.GetHomeWorldName] we have our little scabs play by plucking feathers off birds just like you. You have to see it, it's hilarious, I'm attaching a video with this message, don't forget to rate it!"
 19_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "You k- I thin- W- Damn it, I wanted to pick some feature of your species' wretched body to make fun of, but there's SO MUCH that is obscenely hilarious, I don't even know where to start. Wait online, I'll get back at you..."
 20_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "So, let me get this straight... Interstellar travel: easy peasy! Endoskeleton? Neeh- not quite figured out yet. What do you think that tells you about the state of your species?"
 21_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "You've managed to cross the stars and create technology beyond your wildest dreams, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Yet, you haven't still developed plastic surgery decent enough to make you look better than the defecated remains of a burnt-out dirt-barf?"
 22_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "I'd make a bogey joke, but that'd be too obvious, you doe-eyed slime face."
 23_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "What's next for the great [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] civilization? Our top researchers estimate a placid wobbling in a drunk-like stupor."
 24_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Our agents have filled the rations going to your breeding pits with dehydrating poison commonly known as salt. You have about two hours before your [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] suffer a horrible, horrible death. \n \n Ps: I had to take a nap, so this message has been sent with a three hours delay."
 25_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "I feel like I smoked you before. Did I smoke you before? Well, only one way to find out. Please, send half a dozen of your citizens to the nearest [From.GetSpeciesAdj] outpost. Our personnel will take care of the rest."
 26_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "You know, what I'm doing right now would be a lot funnier if you had eyes to see it. Oh, well, not like THAT's the only thing that you're missing..."
 27_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "I swear, your kind is amongst the most annoying we've ever had to deal with. And I won't even have the satisfaction of eating you, by the time this is over. Don't you see how unfair that is?"
 28_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Wait, guys? What do you mean 'insult' it? It's just a bloody plant! Does it even have ears? What am I going to tell to this blasted thing! Guys? ...Guys?"
 29_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "I've been informed good music can affect a plant's growth, so I thought to send you a present on behalf of the [From.GetName]. Here's twelve hours a high-quality radio statics."
 30_INSULT_PROPOSE_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "No chance I'm going to waste time coming up with a stinger for a stupid, damned plant. You can all go burn yourselves, or whatever. [From.GetName] out."
 01_INSULT_ACCEPT_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "I know you are, but what are we?"
 02_INSULT_ACCEPT_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "You are stupid but fair, I'll grant you that."
 03_INSULT_ACCEPT_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "I hear your [From.GetSpeciesMouthName] making sounds, [From.GetSpeciesName], but my translator can't process 'whiny fop'."
 04_INSULT_ACCEPT_ASTRORAPTORS:0 "Wait, are you coming on to me? That's disgusting! What sort of interspecies pervs are you?"
