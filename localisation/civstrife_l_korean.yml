Unfortunately, there was no declared heir and two separate claims have been made on the throne.\n\nThe strongest contender has been crowned [Root.GetRulerTitle] under the name [Root.GetRulerName], but this has done little to settle the issue."
 
 pretender.1.desc_02: "[From.GetRegnalName] has transcended this realm of existence and begun the journey towards the next. Unfortunately, the Spirits have not yet seen fit to bless us with sufficient signs and portents to conclusively identify a successor.\n\nAfter a heated debate, [Root.GetRulerName] has been crowned as the next [Root.GetRulerTitle] but not without opposition. Pretenders from the senior ranks of the clergy are now attempting to galvanize support."
 
 pretender.1.desc_03: "[From.GetRegnalName] has died without a clear heir, leaving our government in disarray.

There is sadly no declared heir, and this has raised some contention among the nobility.\n\n[Root.GetRulerName] has already been crowned on [Root.Capital.GetName], but Pretenders claiming distant kinship with [From.GetRegnalName] has challenged the new [Root.GetRulerTitle]."
