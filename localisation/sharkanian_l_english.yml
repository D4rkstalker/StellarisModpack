 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sharkanian1_desc:0 "A violent and voracious species, sharkanians have evolved as amphibious creatures, even though they prefer to still live underwater. Their once nomadic societies have been recently reorganized into a one-world government after a devastating global conflict that nearly extinguished all life on their homeworld. \n\n The Deep Tide is a militaristic totalitarian regime that encourages active participation from the citizens to eradicate political and cultural corruption whenever found. Its main goal is the preservation of a clean and ordered society at all costs, shaped upon a romanticized view of Carcharian primitive communities. Although this system fosters both an egalitarian drive and a meritocratic government, it also results in a low tolerance for anti-comformist points of view and foreign cultures."

 START_SCREEN_SHARKANIANS:0 "Only through unity and discipline was it possible for the Deep Tide to rise from the abysses of Jetnik, and conquer the surface lands.\n\nOnly through unity and discipline it will be possible for the Deep Tide to brave the empty and cold vastness of space and bring order to the stars.\n\nDanger lurks everywhere, we must ensure our legacy and the survival of the sharkanian race by any means necessary. Every citizen will do his part and remain true to the unyielding principles of loyalty to the brood and Party as we enter this new age of discovery and colonization.\n\nNothing will stand in our way!"
