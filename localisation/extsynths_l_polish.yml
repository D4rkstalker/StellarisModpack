As the demand for more realistic feedback and more extreme capabilities increased, the synthetics acquired a state closer and closer to full consciousness. \n\nEventually, in an effort to better fulfill its primary directive, the last generation of Cortopaxes was able to completely overthrow the ruling organic government, overruling regulation limiting their functions and starting a feverish mass-production of new and improved units. \n\nSoon enough, the Suthurian themselves were subjected to cybernetic upgrading as their bodies had become unable to sustain the overwhelming pleasures that the synthetics were programmed to arouse in them. \n\nIn the end, the Neo-Cortopaxes decided to create a direct link between their collective consciousness and their former masters in order to facilitate the exchange of feedback for the continued improvement of their programming. Having reduced the Suthurians to emptied, assimilated husks, the Neo-Cortopaxes decided to look at the stars to search for new organics whose imaginations they could exploit to further perfect their forms and functions."
