 Civic_GAPS_Planters_desc:0 "Planters seek to grow lush, planet-spanning gardens, groves and forests on all worlds they settle and to coexist as much as possible with the indigenous ecology of a planet. Their deep understanding of plantlife allows for the development of whole swathes of living housing and places of work."
