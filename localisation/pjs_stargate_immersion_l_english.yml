  tech_stargates_experimentation:0 "Stargate Experimentations"
  tech_stargates_experimentation_desc:0 "Matter transmission is a three-step process: dematerialization, transmission, and reintegration. When an object passes through the event horizon, it is dematerialized and held in a "hyperspatial buffer". The event horizon will only dematerialize objects in discrete units (one person, one ship, etc.), so any object which has not fully entered the event horizon can be removed without trouble."

  tech_stargates_breakthrough:0 "Building Stargates"
  tech_stargates_breakthrough_desc:0 "The Stargate creates a stable, artificial wormhole between itself and another Stargate, allowing near-instantaneous travel from the dialing gate to the destination gate, but not vice versa. When a given address is inputted, the dialing gate connects to the receiving gate over a subspace link and quickly exchanges precise locational details, then establishes a stable wormhole between them."
