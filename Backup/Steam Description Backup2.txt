Stellaris version 3.8.4 - NOT achievement compatible - English only

For a more dynamic and realistic Galactic Community.

[h1] Mod introduction: [/h1]
This mod merges the contents of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2274356555] Galactic Community Expanded [/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056704792] Galactic Community ++ [/url] mods. Additionally I have modified these resolutions in a way that makes them way more interesting. For example, the Authoritarian lvl 5 resolution now bans the Democratic authority, and the lvl 5 egalitarian resolution now bans Imperial and Dictatorial authorities (I have scripted breach fixes and events for all of these new changes as well that AI can also use). Or as another example, all resolutions that are for a specific ethic now add ethic attraction to it and later on decrease ethic attraction for the opposite ethic (lvl 6 authoritarian resolution adds +100% authoritarian ethic attraction and -50% egalitarian ethic attraction).

[h1] Summary of what this mod adds: [/h1]
[u]New resolutions[/u]: 6 new Authoritarian resolutions, 6 new Xenophobe resolutions, new 6 Xenophile resolutions, 6 new Hivemind resolutions, one crystalline protection resolution, 6 new crime resolutions, 6 new corporate crime resolutions, 6 new exploration resolutions, 6 new healthcare resolutions, 2 new history resolutions, level 6 resolutions for all regular vanilla resolutions (with the exception of the Defense Privatization category), level 4 sanctions, galactic population controls resolution (to reduce endgame lag, AI will never propose it);

[u]New mechanics (added by me)[/u]: Complete overhaul of most vanilla resolutions for AI weights (AI will vote smarter) and ethic attraction to ethic-based resolutions (such as the greater good ones and the new authoritarian ones) which also affect vanilla resolutions, certain authorities are now banned for the high level authoritarian and egalitarian resolutions and diplomatic weight will be increased/decreased for high-level resolutions - high-level authoritarian resolutions will decrease diplomatic weight for egalitarians and increase it for authoritarians. (I have scripted breach fixes that AI can also use, and combined with the ethics attraction whatever side dominates in diplo weight should be able to change the whole galaxy to adopt their ideologies over time). The senate timer has also been significantly sped up to compensate for the number of resolutions.

[h1] This mod modifies the following vanilla files (selective means higher compatibility with mods that also modify these files unless they do a full overwrite or modify the same lines of code): [/h1]
[u]localisations[/u]: federations_I_english - [b]full overwrite[/b] (other languages have not been updated to work with my modifications);
[u]events[/u]: federations_events_1 - [b]selective light[/b];
[u]resolutions[/u]: 00_resolutions - [b]selective heavy[/b], 01_resolutions_nemesis - [b]selective heavy[/b], 02_resolutions_overlord - [b]selective heavy[/b];
[u]static_modifiers[/u]: 11_static_modifiers_federations - [b]selective light[/b];

NOTE: [b]Heavy[/b] - high amount of code is modified, very low passive compatibility chance; [b]Medium[/b] - moderate amount of code is modified, medium chance of passive compatibility; [b]Light[/b] - low amount of code is modified, high chance of passive compatibility.

NOTE: It is recommended to have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1623423360&searchtext=UI+overhaul]UI Overhaul Dynamic[/url] installed alongside as it makes the windows bigger and longer text fit inside the blocks.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- [u]Expanded Espionage and Diplomacy[/u]: [b]Major Incompatibility[/b] - Requires the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2975286025]NGS + EED Compatibility Patch[/url];

- [u]More Emperor and Custodian Resolutions[/u]: [b]Minor/Medium Incompatibility[/b] - The developer of MECR has said that their mod has passive compatibility built-in for NGS, however some users have encountered some issues using the two together - Caution is advised;

- [u]Planetary Diversity: Planetary Habitats[/u]: [b]Minor Incompatibility[/b] - Minor conflicts with planetary designations, can be fixed using Irony Mod Manager's conflict solver.

[h1]Suggestions and feedback:[/h1]
Feel free to leave feedback and suggestions in the comments and discussions if you have any ideas or have encountered any bugs regarding this mod. I will try to implement fixes/new features as soon as I have time to do so. I expect there to be some bugs, as this is my first big mod.
