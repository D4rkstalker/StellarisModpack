Better Naval Capacity gives you a few ways to increase your naval capacity:

Adds 4 new techs to raise naval capacity.
Adds 4 new techs to raise starbase capacity.

Changes the penalty for being over your starbase capacity limit to 10% / starbase over the limit (normally 25% each)

Adds an influence based edict to temporarily raise your naval capacity by 20%
Adds an influence based edict to temporarily raise your starbase capacity by 33%

Mildly increases the number of starbases you can support based on how many systems you control.

Additionally, this mod increases the Admiral and General exp gain after combat to make them level up more in line with your other leaders.
