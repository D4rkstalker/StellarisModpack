[h2]For Stellaris: 3.0.*[/h2]

Adds 26 new [b]Planetary Wonders[/b], with custom icons, images and flavour events.
Wonders are planet buildings that take up a district slot, a lot of resources and time to build, but provide many jobs and bonuses.
Only one Planetary Wonder allowed per planet, more are unlocked by the new Ascension Perk.
Wonders need the Voidborne AP to be built in Habitats.
Every Wonder is planet-unique, and some are empire-unique.
