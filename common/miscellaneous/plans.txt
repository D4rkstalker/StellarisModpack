#Things which are needed to be done (in no particular order)


#1.Make machines better on ensign, currently organics outperform them which shouldn't happen

#2.Make federations form

#3.Clean up technologies, current ai_weight while work suffer from gigantomania

#4.Rework the science-alloy system to make it work same way minerals and food work

#5.Improve requirements for minerals and food 

#6. Make preparing for ecumenopolis be smooth. Until captain AI can build ecumenopolis I shouldn't be satisfied with its handling

#7.Write antirush techniques vs human players

#8.Playing as a federation is too easy, find a way to fix it

#9.Improve energy spending. AI doesn't want to fight without armies sadly. Maybe it means we shouldn't go 
#over navalcap (I hope not)

#10.Maybe get rid of any_owned_pop checks in planets, it may help performance a bit 

#11.Make gestalts do something in the lategame instead of ecumenopolies. Maybe machine worlds?

#12.Don't be lazy and make hives and machines have different code for buildings and districts.
#Number of clutches which are in the code is way too high at the moment.

#13. Make AI follow "builds"
