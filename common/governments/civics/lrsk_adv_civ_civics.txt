### CIVCS

#Shapers (Not Essentialists or Artificers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that it is life that matters most to living beings, and its careful cultivation is the highest purpose of knowledge. (+5 leader age, -10% genetic modification cost, +10% habitability, -5% non-society research from jobs, start with "Eco Simulation" tech.)

#Artificers (Not Essentialists or Shapers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that the things sapient beings create, their tools and crafts, that matter most.

#Essentialists (Not Artificers or Shapers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that solving the deepest and most abstract mysteries of the very fabric of reality are the true purpose of knowledge.
