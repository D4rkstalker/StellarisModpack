 pc_o_star:0 "O 星类"
 pc_o_star_desc:1 "这些罕见的, 泰坦尼克号的恒星只在数以百万年的时间内燃烧核燃料, 发出了大量的热量和光。他们惊人的亮度使他们很容易看到, 甚至从许多光年远。"
 sc_o:0 "§HO 星类§!"
 pc_rsg_star:0 "红巨星星"
 pc_rsg_star_desc:1 "红超巨星是高质量的明星接近他们的生命结束。他们的质量允许他们融合更重和更奇异的元素之前, 他们在超新星中爆裂。"
 sc_rsg:0 "§H红巨星星§!"
 pc_rhg_star:0 "Red Hypergiant Star"
 pc_rhg_star_desc:1 "The most massive of stars end their lives as red hypergiants. These titanic stars have barely a million years left before they self-destruct in an especially catastrophic supernova."
 sc_rhg:0 "§HRed Hypergiant Star§!"
 pc_kg_star:0 "Orange Giant Star"
 pc_kg_star_desc:1 "Orange giants are very much like red giants, however they are warmer and slightly brighter as a result."
 sc_kg:0 "§HOrange Giant Star§!"
 pc_ksg_star:0 "Orange Supergiant Star"
 pc_ksg_star_desc:1 "Orange supergiants are high-mass stars nearing the end of their lives. Their mass allows them to fuse heavier and more exotic elements before they implode in a supernova."
 sc_ksg:0 "§HOrange Supergiant Star§!"
 pc_khg_star:0 "Orange Hypergiant Star"
 pc_khg_star_desc:1 "Orange hypergiants are very rare and old stars which are hotter than their red counterparts. These titanic stars have barely a million years left before they self-destruct in an especially catastrophic supernova."
 sc_khg:0 "§HOrange Hypergiant Star§!"
 pc_wd_star:0 "White Dwarf Star"
 pc_wd_star_desc:1 "White Dwarves are the end of a low-mass star's life. These dim renemants form after a red giant has exausted its fuel, causing the outer layers to be blown away and leaving the core to slowly cool."
 sc_wd:0 "§HWhite Dwarf Star§!"
 pc_l_star:0 "Class L Star"
 pc_l_star_desc:1 "Brown dwarves like this one are not massive enough to sustain the fusion reactions that define a 'true' star. Class L brown dwarves output a respectable amount of heat and light, but are outshone by their larger companions."
 sc_l:0 "§HClass L Star§!"
 pc_y_star:0 "Class Y Star"
 pc_y_star_desc:1 "These objects are on the fuzzy line between star and planet. They emit virtually no heat or light and are about room temperature. Planets orbiting these bodies are heated solely through geothermal energies."
 sc_y:0 "§HClass Y Star§!"
 pc_wr_star:0 "Wolf-Rayet Star"
 pc_wr_star_desc:1 "Wolf-Rayet stars are in the last stages of their lives. They have run out of hydrogen and helium and are fusing the last few elements they can before fusing iron and going supernova. Their incredibly powerful stellar wind blows away the outer layers of the star."
 sc_wr:0 "§HWolf-Rayet Star§!"
 pc_temporal_inhibitor:0 "Temporal Inhibitor"
 pc_temporal_inhibitor_desc:1 "This ancient structure generates the strange temporal field in which the system is contained. Who could have constructed it?"
 pc_pr_star:0 "Primordial Star"
 pc_pr_star_desc:1 "This star appears to be one of the first stars in the universe! Primordial, or population III, stars arose from pure hydrogen straight from the big bang itself, before even galaxies took shape. These original stars all burned out in only a few million years after they were formed, but this sole survivor lives on in the unique temporal field where it will never grow old or die."
 sc_pr:0 "§HPrimordial Star§!"
 pc_grn_star:0 "Green Star"
 pc_grn_star_desc:1 "How does it even exist? Normal stars do produce green light, but it is normally drowned out by the other wavelengths, resulting in a white star; however, this star is producing a distinct lime green light, and nothing else. None of our theories can yet explain this anomaly."
 sc_grn:0 "§HGreen Star§!"
 pc_barycenter:0 "Barycenter"
 pc_barycenter_desc:1 "This is not an actual object; rather, it is an imaginary point that two binary objects orbit."
 sc_rogue:0 "§HRogue Planet§!"
 
 magnetar:0 "Magnetar"
 magnetar_desc:0 "This young neutron star projects an extremely powerful magnetic field, many millions of times stronger than an average star's. These fields will gradually weaken into that of a mature neutron star."
 carbon_star:0 "Carbon Star"
 carbon_star_desc:0 "Carbon stars are giant stars with unusually large amounts of carbon in their upper atmosphere. The carbon absorbs various wavelengths of light, causing the star to glow a distinct ruby-red."
 quasar:0 "Micro Quasar"
 quasar_desc:0 "This black hole's accretion disk is large and incredibly luminous. As the name implies, they resemble quasars on a smaller scale."
 quark_star:0 "Quark Star"
 quark_star_desc:0 "This exotic star is incredibly close to collapsing into a black hole; only the quarks repelling one another can keep it from imploding."
 oxygen_star:0 "Oxygen Rich Star"
 oxygen_star_desc:0 "This dying star has an unusually high amount of oxygen in its atmosphere, due to the late-stage fusion processes in its core."
 
 morestars_rogue_empire_init_NAME:0 "Rogue Planet"
 morestars_rogue_empire_init_DESC:0 "A rogue planet system. there is no central star and the planetary system wanders in space. §HWARNING:§! this system is harder due to the lack of objects in your starting system."

 morestars.1.name:0 "Enigmatic star"
 morestars.1.desc:0 "We have stumbled across an enormous star several times more massive than any we have seen before. There was no indication of anything unusual until we entered its gravitational domain, whereupon our sensors were overwhelmed and our ships barely able to handle its unimaginable heat. Even stranger are the four enormous structures orbiting just beyond its sphere of influence."
