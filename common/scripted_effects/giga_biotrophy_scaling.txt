#	Bio-trophy bonus scaling
#	by TTFTCUTS
##############################

# Pops working the Bio-trophy job provide a +1% complex drone output buff
# this is fine when you have a limited number of them on a planet, but some megas allow
# a much higher population to be concentrated in a single place, which makes the bio-trophy
# bonus scale way higher than pdx ever intended. This planet modifier adjusts for this
# by giving a scaling malus to complex drone output based on bio-trophy population.

# It is calculated in a way which makes sure that having more bio-trophies is always 
# better, but drops the effective efficiency of additional bio-trophies significantly
# so that the bonuses don't get really absurd without a matching massive population.

# primary inputs
@minPops = 50 # diminishing returns start after this number of pops
@maxPops = 150 # at this number of pops the efficiency of the next one will be minimum
@minEfficiency = 0.2 # efficiency of subsequent pops after maxPops

# intermediary variables, these make the math effects simpler by pre-calculating constants
# update these if the primary inputs are changed or everything will break
@interval = 100 # maxPops - minPops
@halfInterval = 50 # interval / 2
@minPlusHalfInterval = 100 # minPops + halfInterval
