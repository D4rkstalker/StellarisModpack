# species_trait_points: base number of species trait points available for this species class
# species_max_traits: maximum number of traits that species of this class can have (doesn't count those with cost == 0)

#EXAMPLE OF MODDED SPECIES ARCHETYPE
#Will be able to use traits valid for BIOLOGICAL, ROBOT and BIOLOGICAL2
#Has the exact same trait points as BIOLOGICAL
#BIOLOGICAL2 = {
#	inherit_trait_points_from = BIOLOGICAL
#	inherit_traits_from = { BIOLOGICAL ROBOT }

#	robotic: is this archetype's species robotic? Governs various things:
#		- does the species count as robotic (for is_robotic = yes, and various hardcoded checks)
#		- notably can the species grow, or is just assembled?
#	uses_modifiers: should modifiers be generated for this archetype at all?
#}
