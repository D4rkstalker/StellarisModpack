A list of content added so far to this mod

A quick overview:
This mod adds a fallen hivemind empire to the game, refereed to as the sleeper. This ancient hivemind used to be great threat to all multiminded life in the galaxy, but for unknown reasons it has collapsed long ago and has fallen into a deep slumber. Its once tireless drones are now only barely controlled by its will and its presence on the galactic stage has been diminished. How will this looming danger effect the younger nations? 
It has its own unique mechanics and interactions with the galaxy. This mod adds new events, techs, traits, two new colossus weapons and many new scenarios to the game. 

the ancient hivemind has three different forms (more details later down the list):
-dormant/sleeping: 
	This is how the sleeper starts. It is in a deep slumber and can not be interacted with diplomatically. Its territories are hostile, but can still be entered.
	Some groups of drones it have split away from it and formed small, independent hiveminds, which await the sleepers return. They too can be attacked and even invaded without (immediate) repercussions.
	TN-3, a research robot, has set up a station over its capital and is working and an encyclopedia on hiveminds. You can do a number of missions for it in exchange for credits, research points and other rewards. You can also buy things from it, such as the ability to enter the sleepers territories without being attacked.
-frenzied:
	Certain actions and events in the galaxy can agitate the sleeper and make it awake prematurely. It will act like a cornered animal and attack anything around it (with masses of mostly rushed, badly made low-end ships), until it collapses again after a couple of years.
-awakened:
	Like normal FEs, the sleeper can awaken again. It will attempt to become an active galactic power once again. Because of hardcoded limitations, some workarounds were necessary, but it basically functions like normal AEs. It will demand all single minded nations to submit or be destroyed. Submitting will cost a tax of 33% of the empires monthly food and 1-5 pops per year (for livestock). It will try to exterminate all other hiveminds, machine empires and synthetic ascended empires.


the dormant sleeper:
- The dormant sleeper starts with three planets: Its Capital "The Thinkery"(a hiveplanet), which is orbited by a planet called "The Farms" (a gaia worlds which has several species of livestock with unique traits on it) and a second hiveplanet called "The Annex" in another starsystem.
	-these planets all have unique buildings on them, some similar to the ones found on FEs planets, some completly unique.
	-a large part of the pops on these planets are "still drones", drones that are only barely under the hives control and wander around aimlessly. They generate 3 devinacy and are completly unproductive.
	-Its borders act similar to the marauders: They can be entered, but all ships and stations are automatically hostile. It will also never persue or attack in retaliation. Its AI is completly disabled.
	-it has three fleets, two in the 
- placed in its neighboring systems are four "scrambled drones" countries, large groups of drones that have completly broken away from the ancient hivemind. They have formed their own small hiveminds and seek to join the sleeper again once it has awakened again. 
	-They reside on planets that have some valuable resources on them. They will not expand or grow in any way and will only defend their system.
	-They are low tech and can be invaded pretty easily, without the hivemind directly reacting (more on that later). A small fleet of around 3.000 fleet strenght protects their system.
- The player will mostly be interating with TN-3, A research robot that has set up a space station above "The Thinkery". It acts similar to the vanilla enclaves. It can give some lore on the ancient hivemind itself, can sell you its services and offer special missions. It has its own entry further down below.


the frenzied sleeper:
- As mentioned, certain actions will "agitate" the sleeper. There is a hidden variable called "sleeper_agitation", which can be increased in a number of ways, most involving aggression aganst the sleeper or its drones. The exact increase is semi-randomized, to make it feel less "gamey". You can look up the exact chances in the code. Once it reaches 80, TN-3 will send out a warning to all countries of galaxy. Once it reaches 100, it will frenzy.
	-taking out scrambled drones: 15-25 
	-destroying any of its military fleets: 25-35
	-attacking any of its military fleets and loosing: 3-6
	-taking "the Annex": 30-50 
	-taking "The Farms" or "The Thinkery":101 
	-on top of that, every ten years the game rolls a random increase by 0-2 points. The chances are influenced by the existence of marauders, the grey tempest, AEs and strong empires. If an endgame crisis is present, it also has the chance of inreasing by 5 points

- if there is an endgamecrisis present and the sleeper reaches the 100 agitation threshhold, there is a 40% chance that it will NOT awaken at all.
- once the sleeper is frenzied, it immediately annexes all remaining scrambled drone countries, starts colonizing planets and building starbases and buildings. TN-3's station will also be destroyed.
- it will get new fleets that are all low tech and weak compared to its main fleets. It will get new fleets at the end of every year and attempt to basicly spam you to death with weak ships. These fleet are roughly at the strenghth of the great kahns forces.
- If TN-3 is still alive at that point, the two main fleets in the capital system will be locked and not participate in the fighting at all. Entering their system however will unlock them and the AI will make use of them again. Only the main fleet stationed at the annex will still be available for the AI and is one of the main threats of this fight.
- it will be hostile to ALL countries, with now chance at peace or submission.
- it will start invading into every direction. If it succeeds in taking a planet, a huge chunk of the population will be exterminated, some integrated and turned into hiveminded pops and the rest will be livestock. it will also move one pop to "the farms" as a trophy.

- After between four and eight years it will collapse again and return to its previous state. Alternatively, taking "the thinkery" will also force it to collapse again. 
- Upon its collapse, all expansion and reinforcement will stop, its main fleets will return to their original posts above the homeworlds and the rest of the fleets will remain where they are for the rest of the game. All the territory which it took can now be taken back with no repercussion.
- This type of awakening can only happen once, but does not prevent the "normal FE" awakening.
- this type of awakening can also happen as an reaction to the war in heaven.

 
the awakened sleeper:
- like vanilla FEs, the sleeper can awaken. It uses the same conditions as the vanilla ones and has been integrated into the vanilla event (fallen_empires_awakening.1). It does however still have to own "the Thinkery" and "the Farms".
- all countries that hold planets that formerly were held by scrambled drones get a big opinion debuff, making them the first targets of its conquest.
- It will act like normal AEs, with some key differences:
	-because of hardcoded limitations, I can not add new diplomatic interactions. This means that there is no option in the comms screen that allows you to ask to become a subject (or the other way around), like with other empires/AEs. Because of this, the awakened sleeper will trigger an event every couple years, which will give its neighbors an ultimatum: Become a subject or face their armadas. Depending on their ethics, the AI has some special weights for the answer to that ultimatum. 
	-This also includes fallen and awakened empires. Xenophiles and materialist FEs can also awaken as guardians of the galaxy as an response to this ultimatum.
	-it will not try to subjegate other hiveminds, machine empires or syntheticly ascended empires. Instead it will declare a war of extermination on them.
	-single minded, organic empires will be asked to become a "feeder vassal" (creative name, I know). This subjecttype will pay 33% of its food as a tax and give up 1-5 pops every year. These pops will be moved to "the farms", where they will serve as a permanent source of food.
- the awakened sleeper has a similar mechanic to the normal AEs decadence, but changed slightly. Instead of a production and ship debuff, it will get an increasing deviancy modifier (up to 200%) and "still drone" jobs on every planets, decreasing their production differently and maybe even triggering a rebellion on "the farms".
	
-Upon its defeat, there are some events that happen to who ever took "the thinkery" or "the farms"
	-taking "the farms" allows you to get a tech that unlocks the unique species traits that the sleeper used to make the live for its cattle even worse than it already was (and its meat tastier).
	-taking "the thinkery" allows you to get one of two new colossus weapons. Hiveminds will get the "Hive integrator", a powerful weapon that allows you to take planets instantly and turn all its inhabitants into hiveminded pops. Non Hiveminds will get the "hive creator", a weapon wich will turn all pops of a planet into hiveminded pops and form a new hivemind empire, which is a loyal subject to our empire. This hivemind will only have that one planet, so if you want it to properly expand, you will have to take and disband the starbase of that system, so it can build its own there. (it will get a free coonstruction ship upon bein created to do specifically that)


TN-3:
- TN-3 is a research robot who has been working an the "encyclopedia of the singleminded" for many decades now. He has set up a spacestation above the thinkery.
- He can provide some insight into the sleepers history and mechanics
- every five years, the player can ask to help him. He will give a random task, some of which are repeatable, some one time things and some only happen under certain cercumstances. In return, he will give you energy, research points or other rewards. He will also like you more, just like the vanilla enclaves.
- upon reaching 20 opinion with him, he will allow you to buy information on the planets held by the drone countries. This way you will know which ones are the most valuable of them.
- upon reaching 60 opinion with him, he will allow you to buy the ability to travese the sleepers territory without getting harmed for 2000 energy. Attacking the (now neutral) sleeper will of course reverse that.
- if a certain mission has been completed, you can also buy a damage buff against the sleeper from him.
- if the sleeper awakens in any way, TN-3 will try to flee his station. He will ask for help from any empire that he has more than 100 opinion of. accepting will net that empire a very powerful scientist. If refused to often or if there are no countries that he likes, he will be destroyed.

missions:
-recover some remnants from a random planet, uncolonized planet in your empire.(repeatable)
-if you own a planet that has been held by one of the scrambled drones, he will ask you to do some research on there. This will give you a damage boost against the sleeper and make it available for others to buy (unique)
-TN-3 needs some help for his research. This will give you a -90% sociology modifier for a year, after which you will get engineering or physics research points. Also has the chance to give one of your leaders the genetics specialization trait. (repeatable)
-a drone pop has broken free from the hives will and is looking for refuge. TN-3 wants you to take it in and study its behavior. Will create three pops of the sleeper withoit the hiveminded trait on your capital. Instead, they will have the special "former drones" trait. Depending on how the project goes, these may die or stay in your empire as new citizens. (only for non hive/ non robot exept servitors, unique)
-asks for repairs. You spend some engeneering research in turn fo some energy.
-asks for spare parts. Sell some alloys to him at a very good price. (only if ME or has robots)
-(only for hives) asks to do some research on some drones. (repetable)
-mission to lower the sleepers agitation. Can be sabotaged to increase it instead. (unique)

-I have set up an event, that gives neighboring AIs these missions as well, but I am not sure, if it works.
