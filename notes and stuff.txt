Well, hello there! Looks like somebody has made it to the files. This is just a text file where I keep notes on what to do, any ideas and what I already finished. Might not make sense to you.

DID DO (for update notes):
So, next big update! This does change some stuff, but should not breaj existing saves.

-added modular districts. Taking the "Home in the sky" ascension perk will now allow you to swap your dyson swarms districts with other, new ones. These include: low-g smelters, leisure stations, civilian industry, server farms (ME only), void sanctuaries (rogue S. only) and spawning chambers (hiveminds only). SOrry in advance for my terrible district icons :)

-you can now research a new late game tech "starscooping", which unlocks a decision on dyson swarms to replace your "mining bays" with "starscooping platforms". These do not need deposits to be built. It also adds a modifier to the swarm that gives miners a flat out bonus of 1 mineral. This tech only shows up if you have taken "home in the sky"

-renamed the "Zero G adaptation" trait to "Muscle Atrophy" because it sounds better
-removed the zero G training policy and its tech. Instead you can now build gravity generators in your dyson swarms after researching the new tech "Commercial Gravity Generators" and prevent the "Muscle Atrophy" - trait showing up that way.

-mine planet decision now removes deposits related to that planet from the swarm
-mining asteroids is now cheaper and always adds four dyson swarm size when finished
-the second upgrade for the dyson swarm housing stations has been moved from the ascension perk to a new tech. You get the option to research it by taking the ap as well as through the normal tech pool.

Stuff to test in the next test run:



TO DO:
-pictures for:
	add job modifier
	events
	

-zero G farmers need extra food from the techs.


ideas for next update:
-dyson swarm primitives
-new civics
-events that add new depoists later in the game (a new asteroid has been found or something)

-civic for megacorps: you play as the only corp that is capable of producing things in space, the planet has been bleed dry of its already few resources. Space junk made rockets to expensive to create for most actors.
-new type of swarm: Upon taking the hiveworlds ascension perk, Hiveminds unlock a new type of dyson swarm, which is focused on industry and pop growth. It is less effective per job, but districts provide more jobs. many Districts are quick to build and require food and minerals.
-add an event that replaces ALL planetary buildings built by AIs on swarms with the swarm versions.

-dyson swarm primitives, how they should work:
	-(spawn system with only one hyperlane /whatever shors compass uses to avoid the AI seeing it as a roadblock)
	- have a settled planet and a settled dyson swarm, both are separate "countries": religious authoritarian (faith) and materialistic egalitarian (the Void). Two countries that use the "primitive" status, their space is occupied by the dyson swarm (if that is possible)
	- attacking one (without consulting the other first) will make the other hostile as well. They will see it as an act of agression towards the entire species and if asked will tell you that and that that its their problem. They dont want any (direct) help
	- occupy their space like a country, but dont build spaceships/buildings/stations/grow pops (like FE)
	- the species is split: The planet always had a rather stratified religious society (god demanded for the seperation of the weak and the strong), so mostly workers lived on the unconfortable dyson swarm. After a short war (planet is dependend on their resources, swarm is dependend their food) they seperated and denounced the faith. The dyson swarm people also developed and installed cybernetics, furthering the distrust between the people. Their treaty said that none of them are allowed to leave their system/ make deals with aliens, leading to FTL only being invented in theories.
	- will lead to some events if neighbored over time (hint at that) only if there is no player present will these events occour to an AI (check each time): 
		-some pops want to join your empire. They want to leave the petty squabbles of their species behind. (from both groups). If refused they will go to a random non xenophobe/gestalt country. If none exist they will "disappear"
		-a scientist wants to join your empire
		-swarm asks for some food, after a freighter was attacked by extremists, you can gift it or exchange it for some alloys. If refused, they wont ask you for help later. (not for AI)
		-a plague has befallen the people on the planet, ask for help (soc. special project, no ship needed). If refused, they wont ask you for help later. (not for AI)
		-MTH 30 years after both events they will ask you for your help again: help them overthrow the other. The swarm will want some monthly food and the planet will want some monthly minerals, allowing them to ignore their treaty and stop trade. 
			-if only one have been supported, this will lead to a small battle two years later, with the supported being the winner. They will then ask what to do from here: become your protectorate, become integrated into your empire or become independend.
			-if only one has been supported, it has a also a 50% chance that your rival (if any exist that are not genocidal) also supports the other. They will ask you for alloys to keep up with the now stronger fleet. Will result in the same as above
			-if both have been supported, they will come together and ask you why:
					"squabbles between savages are fun to watch" - they unite and become a normal empire (faith egalitarian) that hates you
					"The treaty hindered actual negotiations" - they will negotiate and a year later turn into a normal empire (faith egalitarian) as your protectorate
					"You have to invest before you take - prepare for war" - make them permanently hostile to all aliens
