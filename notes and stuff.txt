Well, hello there! Looks like somebody has made it to the files. This is just a text file where I keep notes on what to do, any ideas and what I already finished. Might not make sense to you.

Patch notes:


TO DO:
- origins: change the main species to atrophy species once paradox gets their shit together and fix the command for it
- homeworld change, x
	add an event for discovering it



-use these flags to identify the respective primitives/corp
	corp flag: dyson_corp_belonging_to_primitives_@event_target:hostage_planet_country
	natives flag: dyson_primitives_belonging_to_corp_@event_target:greedy_corp


ideas for next update:
- an event that makes AIs automatically replace "deactivated" districts after they take over other swarms after a couple of years.
- allow higher dyson tiers with the ap?
-origin for lithoids: they live as space dwelling creatures, with asteroid houses built around a star. can eat planets from the start of the game, but that is the only way they can increase their size.
-new type of swarm: Upon taking the hiveworlds ascension perk, Hiveminds unlock a new type of dyson swarm, which is focused on industry and pop growth. It is less effective per job, but districts provide more jobs. many Districts are quick to build and require food and minerals.
-add an event that replaces ALL planetary buildings built by AIs on swarms with the swarm versions.
- new origin: void dwellers + lost home
- new tech: Advanced Supermassive Logistics, which allows empires to mine planets from any system and add their size to a random dyson swarm in their empire. This does however require a starbase with a special building. 
-dyson swarm primitives

-alternate dyson swarm building:
	-a slow process that requires some sort of outpost/source for materials
	-decide what districts/buffs the swarm will have over the course of the building (solarpanels or no upkeep, trade or science, etc)
	-random events about complications, etc.
	-centralization mechanic: How self-sufficent are the habitats? Maybe some sort of buff+debuff for higher/lower centralization. Free jobs for higher revolt chance/less income?
	
	-solar panels district or free upkeep (+egalitarian ethics?)
