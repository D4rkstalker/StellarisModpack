Well, hello there! Looks like somebody has made it to the files. This is just a text file where I keep notes on what to do, any ideas and what I already finished. Might not make sense to you.

Patch notes:
- completed scripted localisation
- adjusted costs of dyson swarms and its upgrades (again). A bit cheaper to build now.


TO DO:

- update AI weights for buildings and districts to the new version (once 2.6 is out)
- new tech: Advanced Supermassive Logistics, which allows empires to mine planets from any system and add their size to a random dyson swarm in their empire. This does however require a starbase with a special building. 
- allow higher tiers with the ap?
- fix that dumb tier one bug for annexed swarms

- origin for megacorps:

Origin Description:

This species has been in a cold war for many, many generations. The two massive factions are about equal in economic and military power, only fighting in proxywars occasionally. With the threat of mutually assured destruction looming above everyone, a mindset focused on ensuring that this delicate balance is maintained has been ingrained in their society. It drove technology and economic growth forward at a rate unheard of before. This megacorperation is notorous for almost breaking this balance: When they invented the tools to make spaceflight and habitation viable, they also opened up a new frontier many believed could result in open conflict between the two factions, breaking the equilibrium so carefully established. Both factions started colonizing their solar system, buying technology and high-quality parts from the company and making it rich in the process. What they did not account for however, is the ambitious leadership of the company. One by one, habitats built by the two nations went dead. In order to not break the equilibrium, they were all declared unfortionate accidents and only sloppely investigated. If even one proofed to be an attack by the other nation, the great war many fear so much would come and wipe this species from the face of the galaxy. To their surprise, four decades after the first station disapearances, all the stations that were thought to be dead suddenly went online again and declaired their succession and subsequent alligience to the corperation. A quick military response could also not be mounted by either faction, since all satelites mysterously went dead at the same moment. As a powerfull third actor this company now controls the entire rest of the solar system, as well as the space above their home planet. The two factions each fear that the other could team up with the corperation or gain an edge by buying cheap materials and tech from them. Instead of retaliation, both started peacfull trading with the megacorperation. With the invention of FTL travel, this may change however.
- start out with fewer pops and no food production, but trade deals with your home planet. You will have to make decisions regarding the planet regularly. 
- You will have to deal with the two bickering factions on your homeplanet one way or another.

Quick Tutorial:
the two nations both have a "powerlevel" that represents their economical, technological and military power. If the balance between them is broken, the planet will decend into nuclear war.
Outright invasion is also not a good idea, since that would result in the planets destruction. Although with enough spacships we could shoot their missiles down...
If one of them gathers enough power, the nation will discover FTL technology and may secretly settle another system. This may also open the door for them to unite and declar an open war against you.
random, conditional events will happen that may influence the political world as well.
you can also manipulate the powerlevel by making research or trade agreements with either powers through decisions. These will also net you some special resource deposits on the dyson swarm.
Both factions start at a powerlevel of 10.


decisions (all in one event window, influence cost of 50? for every action to prevent abuse of this):
- check powerlevel: displays powerlevel and chance for open conflict or the planet uniting against you.
- establish trade: Choose either the C or A. Will spawn a corresponding "trader" deposit that adds one tradevalue to the dyson swarm. +1 power to the faction. Costs 200 energy. (cost doubles after ten, maximum of twenty)
- research cooperative: Gain a small amount of science. +1 power to whatever faction you choose.
- import food: adds a new food deposit from either faction. will give both +4 power to represent you becoming more dependend on their planet. 5 food per month for 5 energy per month and a payment of 200 up front.
- export at a loss: export resources at a loss. This will take power away from them, as they become dependned on your resources. They will never refuse, since the other nation could use this to their advantage. -6 minerals +1 energy, -2 power for both
(all deposits can be removed again, taking power away again)


- events:
	-terror attack (a, only at 20 power a) 
		There was a terrorattck on [capital.GetName]! One of our main stations was blown up, its debree hitting and destroying others in the vacinity. Many are dead and we have lost valuable resources. We do not know who exactly it was, but sources indicate that the [species.GetName] allied forces were behind this attack. This could also be a setup however. What do we do?
			- Do not risk it. It was all just an accident. 
			- sanction the allies (+1 power c, -one tradevalue)
			- sanction the commonwealth (+1 power a, -one tradevalue)
	-covert attack (c, only at 20 power c) 
		There was a terrorattck on [capital.GetName]! One of our main stations was blown up, its debree hitting and destroying others in the vacinity. Many are dead and we have lost valuable resources. We do not know who exactly it was, but sources indicate that the [species.GetName] commonwealth were behind this attack. This could also be a setup however. What do we do?
			- Do not risk it. It was all just an accident. (+2 power both)
			- sanction the allies (+2 power c, -two traders)
			- sanction the commonwealth (+2 power a, -two trader)
	
	-knowledge theft: robots (C, triggers some time after resarching robots)
		We have heard reports of the [species.GetName] Commonwealth employing robots in their industries and military. We strongly suspect that the tech for them has been stolen from us and there have already been allegations from the [species.GetName] allied powers that we gave it to their enemies. They threathen us with cutting off our foodsupply should we not give them the technology to build robots too. An ambitious politician from the commonwealth however has secretly told us to not give them access to robot technology. In return, we will get some of the mineral surplus the commonwealth will get of the newly employed robots. What do we do?
			- give the Allied forces robots as well (four robot pops created, +4 power both)
			- do not give the allied forces robots (two robot pops created, +2 power commonwealth, -2 power allies, loose the allied food deposit, gain commonwealth mineral deposit)
	-knowledge theft: robots (A, triggers some time after resarching robots)....
	
	-A proposal (at 40 power, will allow you to spawn a federation ally)


powelevel events:	
	
- difference of 10 power: chance every month that the planet decends into war (low, increases with each extra point). this will spawn armies that fight each other on the planet.
	-do nothing, resulting in destruction (a toxic (terraformable) planet, a nuked world with a few pops that surrender to you or an empty nuked world)
	-park your fleet in orbit, shooting down any missiles. With enough ships this will prevent destruction.
	-land your troops. You can choose a to side with a faction or attack both.

- either reaches 50 power: They research FTL technology and unite to take you down. A fleet ready to take over your dyson swarm spawns in the planets orbit. If they succeed, they turn into a spacefaring civilisation at total war with you. They will have a stability debuff from all the chaos and the sudden unity however. You do not have to shoot doen their nukes to take over the planet now.

- you decide to back one of the nations. same rules as above.

independend events:
- you invade the planet. This will result in the planets destruction if there are not enough ships in orbit to shoot down nukes. loose or don't park enough ships in orbit and the planet gets destroyd in nuclear hellfire.

destruction: After any war, the planet may become a barren (terraformable) planet, a nuked world with a few pops that surrender to you or an empty nuked world.

-following outcomes to the event chain:
	0. the planet gets destroyd in nuclear war (empty nuked planet), through other decisions. Makes it either a barren (terraformable) planet, a nuked world with a few pops that surrender to you or an empty nuked world.
	1. you decide that they are to much of a hazard and align an asteroid to destroy the planet. Makes it a barren (terraformable) planet.
	2. you leave them alone comletely (no trading with either or certain choices). They will eventually team up and try to invade with a massive fleet. During the event chain you can also choose to align an asteroid to hit the planet, but the fleet will be able to destroy it at this point, only slowing them down a bit.
	3. You choose to side with one of the factions. You need to build up a fleet to shoot down any rockets fired during the battle and stop mutually assured destrucion and an army to invade with. Depending on how big your fleet parked in orbit is, the planet will either become united or nuked (0.). If your groundforces loose, it will also skip to 0.
		-afterwads you can choose to either become the country that won (both are fanatic militarists and either egalitarian or authoritarian) or stay as the megacorp, annexing the planet
	4. give one of them FTL tech. They will settle an empty planet nearby and are friendly towards you (enough for federation!). Eventually, they will gather a fleet to destroy their old enemy. You can choose to:
		- let them through, resulting in 0.
		- let them through, but only to resettle their original population to the new planet. The remainers will try to coup your corp. It will either fail (and you get to annex the planet) or succed, turning you into the country and declaring war on faction two. you can chose which one happens.
	5. give both FTL tech. This will result in a war in the planets orbit and 0. will happen.
	6. Invade them. Same rules as in 3, but more fleet and armies are required for success.
	
	
to do:



Stuff to test in the next test run:


ideas for next update:
-dyson swarm primitives
-new origins:
-origin for lithoids: they live as space dwelling creatures, with asteroid houses built around a star. can eat planets from the start of the game.
-new type of swarm: Upon taking the hiveworlds ascension perk, Hiveminds unlock a new type of dyson swarm, which is focused on industry and pop growth. It is less effective per job, but districts provide more jobs. many Districts are quick to build and require food and minerals.
-add an event that replaces ALL planetary buildings built by AIs on swarms with the swarm versions.
