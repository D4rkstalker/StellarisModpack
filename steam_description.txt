[B]Aggressive Crisis Engine (ACEMOD)[/B] is a collaborative Stellaris mod with [b]new crisis AI[/b] and a great amount of [b]crisis improvements.[/b]

[code]a.k.a. crisis is fixed[/code]

Vanilla AI is off for main crises and all fleet movements are mod scripted, this includes military fleets, constructors, army transports and swarm infestors.

Galactic empires receive initial massive damage penalty against crisis factions. New technologies are required to be obtained in order to mitigate this.

[h1]Improvements[/h1]

ACEMOD is flexible and modular. Users are able to switch individual components on and off at game start.

Modders can use ACEMOD AI for their own custom country_types and exclude individual fleets from ACEMOD AI for their own events. Current list of effects for modders to use is inside [b]acemod_fleet_events.txt[/b].

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

This mod is highly compatible but requires disabling vanilla crisis AI. For this reason put ACEMOD below any mod which changes crises (this includes Starnet AI and Glavius AI which overwrite crisis definitions without actually making changes to them).

ACEMOD gives Dimensional Anchors FTL inhibitors makes them visible on a galactic map. Position ACEMOD below any mod which adds components or ship types.

[i]Overnight test run of ACEMOD AI crisis on Stellaris 2.7.2. Default settings but technology cost on x0.25. All empires were on repeatables. Crisis on x1 strength was squashed, this is a x5 Scourge.[/i]
