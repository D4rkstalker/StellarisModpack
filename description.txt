[b]Make sure to put this mod at the bottom of the list in the Paradox Launcher.[/b]

[*]Random weighted generation that every planet has a semi-random mining, farming and generator district
[*]Primary districts are randomly added to planets to provide special resources (primary districts are those that require deposits)
[*]Secondary districts that are choseable via decisions after unlocking the respecitve technology (secondary districts are uncapped and limited to one type per planet)
[*]A decision to upgrade your secondary district when you unlock an additional tech and you planet has more than 40 pops to get powerful bonuses
[*]Special districts like slums for thrall worlds (those worlds have modified mechanics)
[*]Expanded ringworld districts with the asteroid belt mining (counts as a secondary) and a universal district for gestalt empires
[*]Ocean districts as a unique mechanic, their deposits reduce the planets max amount of districts, but the districts increase to planets max amout of districts
[*]Underground cities as a powerful district locked behind an ascension perk, which grants a one time per planet decision to find suitable caves, in those caves you can constuct cities which won't indirectly reduce the planets possible amount of districts
