Adds new origins to the game.  More coming soon!

[h1]New origins[/h1]
[h3]Irradiated Evolution[/h3]
Ever wanted to start on a Tomb World with Tomb World preference?  Now you can!  Start as the weird mutant cockroaches that took over Earth once humanity nuked itself into extinction.
[list]
[*]What it does: starts you on a Tomb world with the Tomb World preference and the Mutant trait, which costs 3 trait points.  Just getting free Tomb World habitability would be OP, so this is what I came up with.  I chose to make the Mutant trait cost trait points so that [i]you[/i] can choose what negative traits your species has picked up through generations of radiation exposure.
[/list]

[h3]Next Generation[/h3]
Start with a species of pre-sapients on your homeworld.  Choose their portrait, namelist, and traits, then uplift them and turn them into delicious, delicious burgers.

[h3]Starship Graveyard[/h3]
Your homeworld is littered with wrecked starships, left there by some galactic litterer in eons past.
[list]
[*]What it does: start the game with several blockers that, when cleared, will give you  between 1 and 4 ships of a random design.
[/list]

[h3]Stellar Cornucopia[/h3]
Start the game with a guaranteed Terraforming Candidate in your home system, as well as additional resources (and some strategic ones, too) on your nearby planets and asteroids.

[h3]Stellar Cornucopia[/h3]
Get a head-start on Genetic Ascension!  Your species has already unlocked the secrets of genetic engineering, granting you extra trait points at the cost of a few starting pops.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Currently overwrites some stuff in 00_start_of_game_effects, the species_classes folder, the game_start.8 event, and several civics.

Works with 2.6.*.
