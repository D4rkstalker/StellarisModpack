[i]Several millennia ago, the galaxy had glimpsed apocalypse when Ascended Empires waged war and brought death to countless civilizations. Convinced of the righteousness of this Great Crusade, each Ascended Empire pushed the limits of science, fielding massive fleets armed with new superweapons at every turn, each more dangerous than the last. Great battles were fought with many more planets caught in the crossfire, leaving thousands of tomb worlds echoing through the void of space. Today, the Titan guns lay silent, their technology not yet reimagined by the primitives who had survived the Great Crusade. Few empires would reach the pinnacle of civilization, and the lessons of the Great Crusade showed that even the mightiest can fall. For all their achievements, now the Fallen Empires are shadows of their former selves, crippled by internal fighting and general apathy. Oh they have seen war like the primitives wouldn¡¦t believe, and that is why they must stand as eternal reminders for all younger races the value of galactic peace.[/i]


The Zenith of Fallen Empires retraces the steps of the fallen, their rise to the pinnacle of civilization and military might. The mod imagines that they were once Ascended Empires wielding massive power, all pursuing their own vision for the galaxy. However, with great power, comes great responsibility, and possibly consequence. In a dangerous era where Ascended Empires carve out their own sphere of influence, lesser empires must align themselves or face annihilation. All-out war between the Ascended Empires would return the galaxy back to the inferno it once was many millennia ago during the Great Crusade. Originally designed as a full experience of this journey in a previous iteration, The Zenith of Fallen Empires 2.0 will be delivered with several add-on component mods, allowing players the full freedom to customise their game based on the features they need to tell an epic story of their empire¡¦s rise ¡V and fall.
