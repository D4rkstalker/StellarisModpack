I'm a big fan of NaK1119's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1771845682]Planetary Development Notification[/url] mod. His mod overwrites the vanilla message_types file. Unfortunately patch 2.6 adds a few new message types to that same file, which causes a few issues with messages lacking their graphical icon. NaK1119 has announced he has abandoned Stellaris modding and that anyone is free to redistribute his mod. Hence why I'm releasing this update which makes NaK1119's mod compatible with patch 2.6. All it changes, is merging the new message types added by NaK1119 into the vanilla file.

This mod should be compatible with any other mod, except those that too change the message_types file.

Now follows the original mod description:
