# HOW TO MAKE AN EVENT #
##########################

#country_event = { # Specifies the type of the event. 
#	id = example.1 #Unique ID for your event. Must match namespace parameter
#	title = example.1.name #Specifies localization string for the title (Header) of the event
#	desc = example.1.desc #Specifies localization string for event text. Description of what is happening goes there. Multiple can be specified, random one will be selected in this case
#	desc = { #Descriptions can be conditonal
#		text = example.1.desc.conditional #Localization string
#		trigger {
#			#Conditions for this to be avalable. For example: has_authory = auth_machine_intelligence to create robot-specific text
#		}
#	}
#	
#	picture = #a name of a picture to display
#	location = from #A scope to the object that is relevant to the event that player can move to. For example, the planet where event is happening
#	show_sound = #Name of the sound clip to be played when event is shown
#	
#	hide_window = yes #If event is not meant to be seen (Service event that runs some sort of routine or prepares grounds for other events), or there's no person to see (Triggers for AI or object with no owner). Makes title and desc unnecessary.
#	
#	diplomatic = yes #Makes event look like diplomatic communications. For example, first contact event or a conversation with the subterranean people
#	picture_event_data = { #Specifies picture for diplomatic event. Most options are optional here
#		portrait = event_target:contact_empire #Animated portrait. Accepts country, leader or species scope as an input
#		planet_background = event_target:contact_empire #Planet background, if your picture has a window
#		graphical_culture = event_target:contact_empire #City on the planet in the window
#		city_level = event_target:contact_empire #The size of the city. Usable to make planet behind look like capital
#		room = event_target:contact_empire.ruler #Static background. Can use static pictures or scopes as the input
#	}
#	
#	is_triggered_only = yes #The game will not consider this event for starting on its own. Event will need to be triggered by another event, or by some other effect. Most events will use this.
#	fire_only_once = yes #Makes the event happen only once per game
#	
#	mean_time_to_happen = { #The event be considered for starting with daily probability calculated so on average it would happen in time specified. Is not completely reliable, as the event might happen on the first day or never. Useful for events where conditions are not easily acoounted for

#			#Conditions for this modifier to apply
#		}

#		#Trigger block contains conditions. The event will not start if conditions inside aren't met, even if explicitly called. Used for events on mean_time_to_happen or for events that called from situation where you can't or want specify conditions for it to happen, before calling (For example an event in on_action block or a delayed event that might be blocked by other events)
#	}
#	
#	immediate = {
#		#Effects that are applied the moment event fires. Can be effects that can't wait like setting a flag to prevent other events, or the undesirable effects you don't want player to be able to delay (For example, killing science ship's captain.) Also the only block you'll need on hidden events
