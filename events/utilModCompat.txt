##### SET GLOBAL FLAG - PROP_ESP_INSTALLED #####
##### THIS IS REMOVED BY THE UNINSTALL OPTION IN events/utilModConfig
### The only files Prop&Esp overwrites are two .gui files (main.gui and government_view.gui) ###
### The two resource icons in main.gui are not required, as the intelligence window has its own display of those resouces.
### Prop&Esp uses the 'Enigmatic Engineering' ascension perk and the 'Police State' civic, however it only uses a localisation overwite to do so. The mod will work fine even with those two things removed/overwritten.
