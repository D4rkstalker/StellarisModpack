[h2]Compatible with Stellaris: 2.8.*[/h2]

This mod adds new buildings called [b]Planetary Wonders[/b].
The Wonders take up a district slot and take a considerable amount of resources and time to build, but provide a lot of jobs and bonuses to the planet.
Only one Planetary Wonder can be built per planet, unless our Ambition allows for more (see the added Ambition).

Right now there are 7 Wonders implemented (seemed like a fitting number) but many more panned!
Special attention shall be given to flavor and balance, so any input to keep the numbers reasonable is welcome.
