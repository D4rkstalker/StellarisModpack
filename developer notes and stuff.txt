This is where I keep my notes, ideas for the mod and other things. Don't expect anything based on what I wrote here.

-compatibility:
	-overwrites the FE awakening event (fallen_empires_awakening.1)
	-overwrites the can_orbital_bombard gamerule
	-overwrites the can_add_claim gamerule

TO DO:

-find a workaround for shared comms, as they do not seem to work right now.
-arcane deciphering: get the ability to build one of their buildings from their artifacts if you are a hive.
-new interactions with federations, maybe ultimatums?
-add a new origin for hives that lets you start as a subhive
-if it went berserk, you can ask it after its true awakening. It will say that it can't remember anything about it in the diplo screen.
-add more pictures to the events

Patchnotes:

ideas, minor to does:

SUFF TO TEST ON THE NEXT TEST RUN:

- does decadence work with the awakened sleeper?


important flags:

eternal_slumber: flag to put it to sleep forever
